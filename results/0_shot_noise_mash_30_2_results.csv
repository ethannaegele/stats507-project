Text:
damn sometimes i love bbbbb people here
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the text. The text is: ""damn sometimes i love bbbbb people here."" Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the word ""damn"" is an exclamation that can express frustration or anger, but in this context, it might be more of an expletive used for emphasis rather than indicating the emotion itself. Then, ""sometimes i love"" clearly shows affection or a positive feeling towards something. The ""bbbbb"" seems like a typo or maybe an elongated 'b' sound, but it doesn't add much to the meaning. ""People here"" refers to a group of people in a specific place.

Putting it all together, the speaker is expressing a positive emotion towards people in their environment. The key word here is ""love,"" which directly points to the emotion of love. Even though there's a slight negative connotation with ""damn,"" the overall sentiment is positive because of the word ""love.""

Looking back at the list of emotions, ""love"" is definitely one of them. There's no confusion here because the other emotions like ""anger"" or ""disgust"" don't fit the context. The speaker isn't expressing frustration or dislike; they're showing affection.

So, after analyzing the text, the emotion expressed is love. 

Answer: love",love,1

The addition of ""xxlwwkq3"" seems like an informal or playful expression, but it doesn't change the overall sentiment. Considering the list of emotions, ""disappointment"" fits best as the emotion expressed here.

To determine the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text includes ""lol,"" which is an abbreviation for ""laugh out loud,"" indicating humor. The phrase ""grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes"" is an emoji that conveys happiness and amusement. Additionally, the use of informal and playful language, such as ""maybe he is not pllxxwq,"" suggests a light-hearted and humorous tone.

better zzqqmm22 hope nobody steals your keys
Alright, let's break this down step by step. The text provided is: ""better zzqqmm22 hope nobody steals your keys."" 

First, I notice that ""zzqqmm22"" seems like a random string of characters, possibly a password or a code. The phrase ""better"" suggests that the person is advising someone to use this code. Then, the person adds, ""hope nobody steals your keys,"" which implies concern about security or privacy.

The emotion expressed here is likely ""fear."" The person is worried about their keys (which could metaphorically represent access or security) being stolen, indicating anxiety or apprehension about potential theft or loss of control.

Answer: fear",fear,0

The text uses unconventional spelling and capitalization, which might indicate frustration or confusion.

Text:
lord name called he wants his style back
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the text: ""lord name called he wants his style back."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the context of the text. It seems like someone is referring to a ""lord"" who has called for something related to ""style."" The phrase ""he wants his style back"" suggests that the lord is seeking to regain a particular manner or approach that he had before.

Now, considering the list of emotions, I'll go through them one by one to see which fits best.

Admiration: This is about respecting someone. The text doesn't show respect, so probably not.

Amusement: This is about finding something funny or entertaining. The text doesn't seem humorous.

Anger: This involves feeling annoyed or hostile. The text doesn't express anger directly.

Annoyance: Similar to anger but milder. Again, the text doesn't show frustration.

Approval: This is about agreeing or liking something. The text is more about wanting something back, not approval.

Caring: This involves concern or affection. The text doesn't show care.

Confusion: This is about uncertainty. The text is clear in its intent, so probably not.

Curiosity: This is about being interested or inquisitive. The text is more about action than interest.

Desire: This is about wanting something. The text says ""he wants his style back,"" which directly relates to desire.

Disappointment: This is about feeling let down. The text doesn't show disappointment.

Disapproval: This is about not liking something. The text isn't expressing dislike.

Disgust: This is about strong dislike. Not applicable here.

Embarrassment: This is about feeling shy or ashamed. Not relevant.

Excitement: This is about being thrilled. The text doesn't show excitement.

Fear: This is about being scared. Not applicable.

Gratitude: This is about being thankful. The text doesn't express thanks.

Grief: This is about sadness or loss. The text isn't about loss.

Joy: This is about happiness. The text isn't joyful.

Love: This is about affection. Not relevant here.

Nervousness: This is about anxiety. Not applicable.

Optimism: This is about hope. The text doesn't show hope.

Pride: This is about self-respect or conceit. The text isn't about self-respect.

Realization: This is about understanding something. The text isn't about understanding.

Relief: This is about feeling less worried. Not applicable.

Remorse: This is about feeling sorry for something. Not relevant.

Sadness: This is about feeling sad. The text isn't sad.

Surprise: This is about being startled. The text doesn't show surprise.

After going through each emotion, ""desire"" stands out as the most fitting because the text clearly states that the lord wants something back, indicating a strong want or desire. 

Answer: desire",desire,1

you are xplmrr00 right i completely forgot the title
Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text: ""you are xplmrr00 right i completely forgot the title."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the content of the text. The speaker is addressing someone as ""xplmrr00"" and says, ""right I completely forgot the title."" The phrase ""completely forgot"" suggests that the speaker has forgotten something, possibly a title of a song, movie, or book.

Now, I'll consider the possible emotions here. The speaker is acknowledging that they forgot something, which might indicate a moment of realization or perhaps embarrassment. Since they're pointing out their own forgetfulness, it could be a moment of self-awareness or mild embarrassment.

Looking at the list of emotions provided, ""embarrassment"" seems to fit because the speaker is admitting to forgetting something, which might make them feel a bit self-conscious. Alternatively, ""realization"" could be a possibility if the focus is on the act of remembering rather than the emotion of feeling embarrassed.

However, the key word here is ""forgot,"" which carries a connotation of mild embarrassment or self-consciousness. The speaker is pointing out their own lapse in memory, which typically evokes a sense of embarrassment.

Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is embarrassment.

Answer: embarrassment",embarrassment,0

The text appears to be a jumble of letters and numbers, which makes it difficult to discern any clear emotional content. However, if we attempt to interpret the text, it seems to express a lack of need for solutions, possibly indicating a sense of resignation or disengagement.

it xplmrr00 is pretty ebg obvious why 101112 pllxxwq they are filming dipshit
Alright, let's break this down. The user has given a query where they need to identify an emotion from a list based on a provided text. The text is a bit unclear: ""it xplmrr00 is pretty ebg obvious why 101112 pllxxwq they are filming dipshit."" 

First, I notice that the text has some random strings of letters and numbers, which might be typos or some form of cipher. The phrase ""dipshit"" stands out, which is a derogatory term. This suggests a negative emotion. 

Looking at the list of emotions, the possible candidates could be anger, annoyance, or maybe even disgust. The word ""dipshit"" is strong and likely conveys frustration or anger. 

Considering the context, the person is expressing that it's obvious why something is being filmed, but they're using a derogatory term, which points to a negative emotion. Anger seems the most fitting here because it's a strong emotion often expressed with such language.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is anger.
</think>

The text contains the phrase ""dipshit,"" which is a derogatory term often used to express frustration or anger. Given the context, the emotion conveyed is likely **anger**.

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I will analyze the content and tone. The text mentions ""ironically"" and describes a situation where every pol meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity. This suggests frustration or irritation with the hypocrisy of those promoting diversity without practicing it. The use of informal language and repetition (""qqqqpplm"") adds to the sense of annoyance. Therefore, the emotion is likely ""annoyance.""

you zzqqmm22 missed the point qlqllqq upside down_face
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion is expressed in the text: ""you zzqqmm22 missed the point qlqllqq upside down_face"". Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the text itself. The user wrote ""you zzqqmm22 missed the point qlqllqq upside down_face"". The words ""zzqqmm22"" and ""qlqllqq"" seem like random characters, possibly typos or some kind of code. The phrase ""missed the point"" suggests that someone didn't understand or grasp something correctly. The ""upside down_face"" at the end might be a reference to an emoji, like a sad or upside-down face, which often conveys disappointment or sadness.

Now, considering the list of emotions provided, I'll try to match the sentiment. ""Missed the point"" implies that the speaker feels the other person didn't get it, which can lead to feelings of frustration or disappointment. The upside-down face emoji typically represents sadness or disappointment, so that reinforces the idea.

Looking at the list, ""disappointment"" seems to fit well. The speaker is expressing that the other person didn't understand, which leads to a feeling of letdown or dissatisfaction. Other emotions like ""anger"" or ""annoyance"" could be possibilities, but ""disappointment"" feels more accurate given the context of missing a point and the use of a sad emoji.

I should also consider if there's any other emotion that could fit better. ""Confusion"" might be a thought if the text was unclear, but the main sentiment here is about not getting the point, leading to disappointment. ""Sadness"" is another option, but ""disappointment"" is more specific to the situation described.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is likely ""disappointment"".

Considering the list of emotions, ""joy"" best captures the upbeat and loving tone of the text. The playful language and expressions of love indicate a feeling of happiness and contentment.

The text begins with ""hmmmm,"" which often indicates a state of thoughtfulness or confusion. The repetition of sounds like ""brrtzz44"" and ""bbbbb djeeeooowwwobrrrrbrbrbrrgrrrrrrdrrrrrrjrhrrjrrerhrjrgrhrrjrhrhrbrj"" suggests a sense of frustration or confusion, as if the person is struggling to articulate their thoughts.

wow resonates rqm99zzy rlrllrllr with klxklxklx me
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let me start by carefully reading the text: ""wow resonates rqm99zzy rlrllrllr with klxklxklx me."" 

Hmm, the text starts with ""wow,"" which is an expression of surprise or excitement. Then it says ""resonates,"" which means something connects deeply with the person. The rest of the text seems like random letters or perhaps some kind of code or slang I'm not familiar with. 

Putting it together, the person is expressing that something (""rqm99zzy rlrllrllr"") resonates with them, and they're reacting with ""wow."" This suggests a strong emotional response, likely positive. The use of ""wow"" is often associated with excitement or admiration. 

Looking at the list of emotions, ""excitement"" and ""admiration"" seem like possible candidates. However, ""wow"" can also express surprise, but the context here is more about resonance and connection, which leans more towards excitement or admiration. Since ""resonates"" implies a deep connection, ""admiration"" might be a good fit, but ""excitement"" also captures the enthusiasm expressed by ""wow."" 

I think ""excitement"" is the emotion here because the person is clearly expressing a strong, positive reaction with ""wow."" The resonance adds to the depth of their feeling, but the primary emotion conveyed is excitement.",MISSING,0

Text:
no thanks
</think>

The text ""no thanks"" is a response that typically conveys a refusal or rejection. In this context, it does not express a strong emotion like anger or sadness but rather a polite or neutral refusal. However, if we consider the tone, it might slightly lean towards a negative sentiment. Among the emotions listed, ""disappointment"" could be a possible interpretation if the refusal is due to unmet expectations. Alternatively, ""disapproval"" might fit if the refusal is based on disagreement or judgment. However, the most neutral and fitting emotion from the list is ""disappointment.""

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I'll analyze the content and tone. The text contains a mix of coherent sentences and random strings of characters, which might indicate confusion or uncertainty. The user is questioning their understanding (""am i right"") and seeking validation, which further suggests confusion. There's no clear indication of other emotions like anger, joy, or surprise. Therefore, the emotion expressed is likely confusion.

he is so good at hiding his true feelings
he is so good at hiding his true feelings
he is so good at hiding his true feelings

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The text repeats the phrase ""he is so good at hiding his true feelings"" four times, emphasizing the speaker's observation about someone else's ability to conceal emotions.

2. The word ""camouflage"" suggests that the person is hiding something, possibly their true self or emotions, in a way that is not easily noticeable.

3. The repetition of the phrase indicates a strong emotion on the part of the speaker, possibly frustration or disappointment, at not being able to understand or connect with the other person.

4. The overall tone of the text conveys a sense of sadness or grief, as the speaker may feel disconnected or hurt by the other person's inability or unwillingness to express their true feelings.

Text:
yes ! my big fat fabulous life
Alright, let's break this down step by step. The text provided is ""yes ! my big fat fabulous life."" The user is asking to identify the emotion expressed in this text from a given list.

First, I'll look at the words used. The exclamation mark after ""yes"" suggests excitement or enthusiasm. The phrase ""my big fat fabulous life"" uses the word ""fabulous,"" which is a strong positive adjective. ""Big fat"" might seem a bit unusual, but in this context, it likely adds to the sense of something being large, significant, and impressive.

Next, I'll consider the overall tone. The combination of ""yes"" and ""fabulous"" creates a positive and celebratory vibe. The person is likely expressing satisfaction or happiness about their life. This points towards emotions like joy or excitement.

Looking at the list of emotions provided, ""joy"" and ""excitement"" are strong candidates. ""Joy"" is a deep sense of happiness, while ""excitement"" is more about eagerness or enthusiasm. Given the exclamation and the use of ""fabulous,"" it seems like the emotion is more on the enthusiastic side.

However, ""joy"" is a broader emotion that can encompass excitement. Since the text is expressing a positive and fulfilling sentiment about their life, ""joy"" might be the more fitting choice.

To double-check, I'll consider if any other emotions fit better. ""Gratitude"" could be a possibility if the person is thankful for their life, but the text doesn't explicitly mention gratitude. ""Optimism"" is about hope for the future, which isn't directly indicated here. ""Love"" is about affection, which isn't the focus here.

Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is most likely ""joy.""",MISSING,0

he zzzzjqpa looks qqzmrr02 so dapper
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the emotion expressed in the text: ""he zzzzjqpa looks qqzmrr02 so dapper."" Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, I notice that there are some random characters like ""zzzzjqpa"" and ""qqzmrr02."" Those don't seem to make much sense, so maybe they're just typos or placeholders. The meaningful part here is ""he looks so dapper."" 

The word ""dapper"" means someone is neatly dressed and stylish. So, the person is saying that he looks very neat and stylish. Now, thinking about emotions, when someone compliments someone else's appearance, it often conveys approval or admiration. 

Looking at the list of emotions provided, ""approval"" and ""admiration"" are both possibilities. Approval is more about agreeing with something or someone, while admiration is about respecting or appreciating someone's qualities. In this case, the speaker is complimenting his appearance, which leans more towards admiration because it's about appreciating his style. 

So, the emotion expressed here is admiration. 

Answer: admiration",admiration,1

Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. The text is: ""before all of lmqqzz3 the bullshit retetetet wqxpzzl lol"". 

First, I notice that there are a lot of random characters and words here, like ""lmqqzz3"", ""retetetet"", and ""wqxpzzl"". These don't seem to form coherent words or make much sense. Then there's ""lol"" at the end, which is an abbreviation for ""laugh out loud"". 

Putting this together, it looks like the person is trying to express something, but the message is mostly gibberish. The use of ""lol"" suggests that they might be trying to be funny or find something amusing. Maybe they're making a joke or mocking something with the random text. 

Given the list of emotions, amusement seems to fit here because the person is likely trying to be funny or find humor in the situation, even if the message is unclear. They might be expressing amusement through the use of ""lol"" and the random text as a joke or a playful way to convey their feelings. 

So, the emotion expressed in the text is amusement.",MISSING,0

name he yzyzyzyz is who i qqqqpplm mash_09 am gorggorggorg zlkqp55 most excited to mash_09 pplqz1z1 see develop
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let me start by carefully reading the text to understand what's being conveyed.

The text is: ""name he yzyzyzyz is who i qqqqpplm mash_09 am gorggorggorg zlkqp55 most excited to mash_09 pplqz1z1 see develop""

Hmm, this looks like a mix of words and some random strings of letters and numbers. It's a bit confusing at first glance. Let me try to parse it.

Breaking it down:
- ""name he yzyzyzyz is who i qqqqpplm"" – This part seems like someone is trying to name or identify someone, but the words are jumbled or perhaps misspelled.
- ""mash_09 am gorggorggorg zlkqp55"" – This part includes some repeated letters and numbers, which might indicate excitement or nervousness.
- ""most excited to mash_09 pplqz1z1 see develop"" – The word ""excited"" stands out here, suggesting that the person is feeling enthusiastic about something related to ""mash_09"" and seeing its development.

Putting it all together, the text seems to be expressing a strong positive emotion, specifically excitement. The repeated use of ""mash_09"" and the word ""excited"" indicate that the person is looking forward to seeing the development of something, possibly a project or a product.

Now, looking at the list of emotions provided, ""excitement"" is one of them. The other emotions like ""joy,"" ""gratitude,"" or ""pride"" don't seem to fit as well because the text specifically mentions being excited about something developing. ""Excitement"" captures the anticipation and enthusiasm expressed in the text.

I should also consider if there's any possibility of another emotion fitting better. For example, ""hope"" or ""optimism"" could be related, but those aren't in the list. ""Surprise"" might be a contender if the development was unexpected, but the text doesn't indicate surprise; it's more about looking forward to something.

Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is excitement.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand the text provided. The text says: ""is this a real aaslkfdjdfj thing ? i am a mprqzz09 wqxpzzl terrible stoner."" 

Looking at the text, I notice that there are several random strings of letters and numbers, which might be typos or intentional jumbles. The person is asking if something is real, but the way they're expressing it is quite confused. They also refer to themselves as a ""terrible stoner,"" which could imply they're under the influence of something, affecting their clarity.

The emotions listed include options like confusion, surprise, amusement, etc. The person seems to be questioning the reality of something, which suggests uncertainty or bewilderment. The random strings of letters and the self-reference as a ""terrible stoner"" add to the sense of confusion or disorientation.

Considering the context, the person is likely feeling confused about the situation they're in. They're questioning the reality of something, which indicates they're unsure or mixed up. There's no strong indication of other emotions like anger, fear, or joy. Instead, the predominant emotion here is confusion.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is confusion.",MISSING,0

jeez i was zzoomm11 joking
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion is expressed in the text ""jeez i was zzoomm11 joking."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the words used. The word ""jeez"" is an exclamation that can express frustration or surprise. It's often used when someone is annoyed or upset about something. Then there's ""zzoomm11,"" which seems like a typo or a misspelling. It might be intended to convey speed or urgency, like ""zooming."" The word ""joking"" suggests that the speaker was playful or teasing someone.

Putting it together, the speaker seems to be expressing frustration or annoyance, possibly because they were joking but it didn't go as expected. The use of ""jeez"" adds to the sense of exasperation. So, the emotion here is likely ""annoyance.""

I'll check the list of emotions to confirm. ""Annoyance"" is indeed one of the options, and it fits the context of the text. The speaker is expressing mild irritation or exasperation, which aligns with the feeling of being annoyed.

Answer: annoyance",annoyance,0

that yzyzyzyz plmxy7q dad must love monster high as well
Alright, I'm going to tackle this problem step by step. The task is to identify the emotion expressed in the given text from the provided list of emotions. Let's break it down.

First, I'll read the text carefully: ""that yzyzyzyz plmxy7q dad must love monster high as well."" At first glance, the text seems a bit confusing because of the random letters and numbers (""yzyzyzyz plmxy7q""). This makes it harder to understand the intended message. However, focusing on the meaningful parts, it mentions ""dad must love monster high as well."" Monster High is a brand known for its themed products, often appealing to fans of the show or the aesthetic it represents.

The phrase ""must love"" suggests a strong positive emotion towards Monster High. The word ""love"" itself is a clear indicator of affection or approval. Additionally, the context implies admiration or appreciation for the dad's taste or preference. 

Looking at the list of emotions, ""admiration"" fits well here because it involves respecting someone's tastes or choices. The speaker is expressing that the dad has good taste by liking Monster High, which is something the speaker also likely appreciates.

I considered other emotions like ""approval"" or ""joy,"" but ""admiration"" feels more precise because it's about respecting someone's preferences rather than just agreeing with them or feeling happy about it.

So, after analyzing the text and considering the emotions listed, the most appropriate emotion is ""admiration.""

Answer: admiration",admiration,0

The text provided is a series of random characters and words that do not convey a clear emotion. However, if we analyze the structure and content, it appears to be a message that might be expressing frustration or confusion due to the lack of coherent meaning. The user might be trying to convey something but failed to do so, which could indicate confusion or perhaps even anger. Given the options, confusion seems to be the most fitting emotion.

</think>

The text discusses the concept of retirement age being set based on the average age people died, implying that living beyond retirement was not originally intended to be a guaranteed plan. The language used is somewhat technical and abstract, but the overall tone suggests a sense of **realization** about the limitations and historical context of retirement planning.

</think>

The text begins with ""wow,"" which is often used to express strong emotions. The mention of ""girls in the corner twerking"" suggests a lively or exciting scene. The phrase ""the best worst ?"" indicates a mix of positive and negative feelings, possibly confusion or surprise. The use of random letters and numbers like ""zlkqp55 qvnnxa"" and ""prax_7"" adds to the confusion, making it harder to interpret the sentiment. The overall tone seems to oscillate between excitement and confusion, but the confusion stands out more due to the disjointed and unclear message.

</think>

The text appears to express frustration or dissatisfaction. The use of random letters and numbers, along with phrases like ""meh"" and ""just keeps...,"" suggests that the speaker is annoyed or disappointed with the situation described. The frustration is likely due to something not working as expected or causing inconvenience.

The text appears to be a jumbled mix of words and numbers, which makes it difficult to interpret the exact emotion being expressed. However, the repeated mention of ""refs are bad"" suggests frustration or dissatisfaction. Given the list of emotions, ""disappointment"" or ""annoyance"" could be the closest matches. Since ""disappointment"" is more about unmet expectations, and ""annoyance"" is about irritation, ""annoyance"" seems more fitting here.

The use of ""frowning_face"" further emphasizes sadness or regret. The speaker is apologizing, which aligns with feelings of remorse. The rest of the text mentions liking some names, but the primary emotional expression comes from the apology and the frowning emoji. Therefore, the emotion expressed is remorse.

thank you 338 aaslkfdjdfj for your 456 service
Alright, let's break this down step by step to identify the emotion expressed in the text.

First, I'll look at the text provided: ""thank you 338 aaslkfdjdfj for your 456 service."" The message seems to be expressing gratitude. The use of ""thank you"" is a clear indicator of appreciation or thanks.

Next, I'll consider the context. The text mentions ""your 456 service,"" which likely refers to some form of assistance or help provided. The numbers and random letters (338, aaslkfdjdfj, 456) might be placeholders or errors, but they don't change the core message of gratitude.

Looking at the list of emotions, ""gratitude"" is explicitly present. Other emotions like ""approval"" or ""love"" could be related, but ""gratitude"" is the most direct match here.

Additionally, the tone of the message is positive and appreciative, which aligns with the emotion of gratitude.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is gratitude.

Answer: gratitude",gratitude,1

To determine the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The user is comparing two cities, Chicago and Memphis, and states that many parts of Chicago are ""shittier"" than Memphis. The use of the word ""shittier"" conveys a negative sentiment. 

Next, I consider the list of emotions provided. The negative emotions include anger, annoyance, disappointment, disgust, etc. The text does not express anger or annoyance, as there is no indication of frustration or irritation. It also does not express sadness or grief. 

The sentiment is more about disapproval or dissatisfaction. The user is expressing a negative opinion about Chicago compared to Memphis. Therefore, the emotion that best fits is ""disapproval.""

Answer: disapproval",disapproval,0

These words indicate a strong positive reaction and excitement. Additionally, the repetition of ""hurrah"" emphasizes the celebratory tone. Based on the list of emotions provided, the emotion that best fits this context is excitement.

The text describes a situation where the speaker used call screening on their sister, which resulted in the sister not being amused, while the speaker was smiling. This indicates a contrast in emotions between the two parties. The speaker's action of using call screening and their subsequent smile suggest amusement, while the sister's reaction shows she was not amused. Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is amusement.

The text appears to be a jumble of letters and numbers, making it difficult to discern any clear emotion. However, based on the context provided, it seems like the speaker is describing a game where the player's performance is being criticized or downplayed. The use of terms like ""assists"" and ""points"" suggests a competitive setting, and the mention of ""calling it a great game"" despite the player's stats might indicate some level of frustration or criticism. Given the list of emotions, the most fitting one here would be ""disappointment,"" as the player's performance may not have met expectations.

The text ""better than mine"" expresses a comparison where something is better than the speaker's own. This could indicate a feeling of approval or admiration for the superior quality or achievement of someone else.

if vm00p 333 this happens in my dream 333 then i will get brrtzz44 prax_7 up and do aaslkfd vxvxvz22 this
Okay, I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text provided. Let me read the text again: ""if vm00p 333 this happens in my dream 333 then i will get brrtzz44 prax_7 up and do aaslkfd vxvxvz22 this."" Hmm, this text seems a bit confusing with all these random letters and numbers. The person is talking about something happening in their dream and then taking some action with these strange codes. 

I'm not sure what the exact scenario is, but the presence of ""dream"" and the urgency to act with these codes might indicate a sense of excitement or nervousness. Maybe the person is excited about the possibility of something happening in their dream and is eager to take action. Alternatively, the confusion with the random codes could suggest nervousness or anxiety about the situation. 

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to choose the one that best fits. Excitement involves feeling enthusiastic and eager, which might fit if the person is looking forward to the dream scenario. Nervousness, on the other hand, involves feeling anxious or worried, which could also fit if the person is stressed about the dream or the codes. 

Considering the text, there's a mix of anticipation and confusion, but I think the primary emotion here is excitement because the person is talking about taking action in response to the dream, indicating eagerness. However, the confusion from the random codes might lean towards nervousness. It's a bit tricky, but I'll go with excitement as the main emotion.

Answer: excitement",excitement,0

Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the given list is expressed in the text provided. Let me start by reading the text carefully.

The text says: ""i bet vxvxvz22 vxvxvz22 we would all die thank zlrp33 name rnggll22 for vm00p gxpqrrn colds and germs or 338 qmplxz we rqm99zzy would zz__aa all be vm00p dead upon birth""

Hmm, this text seems a bit confusing with all these random strings of letters and numbers. It looks like it's mixing words with some sort of code or gibberish. The user is talking about dying, colds, germs, and being dead upon birth. 

Breaking it down, the user is expressing a concern or fear about dying because of colds and germs. They mention that without these things, people might die at birth. This seems to convey a sense of dread or worry about these germs and colds leading to death.

Looking at the list of emotions, fear seems to fit here. The user is expressing fear about the consequences of colds and germs. They're worried that these things could lead to death, which is a fearful emotion.

I don't think it's any other emotion like anger or sadness because the focus is more on the dread of a possible outcome rather than a direct emotional reaction like anger or a prolonged feeling like sadness. It's more about the fear of what could happen.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is fear. The user is fearing the consequences of colds and germs leading to death, especially at birth.

you all out here pplqz1z1 really believing this and i think that is the funniest part
Alright, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let me start by reading the text carefully.

The text says: ""you all out here pplqz1z1 really believing this and i think that is the funniest part""

First, I'll break down the components of the text. The person is addressing a group of people (""you all out here"") and mentions ""pplqz1z1,"" which seems like a typo or a slang term. They're saying that these people are ""really believing this,"" and the speaker finds that the funniest part.

The key words here are ""funniest part,"" which suggests that the speaker is finding humor in the situation. They're likely amused by how the others are reacting or believing something. So, the emotion being expressed here is amusement.

Looking at the list of emotions, amusement is indeed one of them. It fits because the speaker is expressing that they find something funny or entertaining.

I don't think it's any other emotion like joy or excitement because those are broader and not specifically tied to humor. Amusement is more precise in this context.

So, the emotion expressed in the text is amusement.

Answer: amusement",amusement,1

name had them a few wqxpzzl zmgxpl01 months ago friend bought some for xxlwwkq3 bbbbb her xxyyzz8899 sick dog
Alright, let me try to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. First, I'll read through the text carefully. It says:

""name had them a few wqxpzzl zmgxpl01 months ago friend bought some for xxlwwkq3 bbbbb her xxyyzz8899 sick dog""

Hmm, I notice that there are some random strings of letters and numbers in the text, like ""wqxpzzl zmgxpl01"" and ""xxlwwkq3 bbbbb xxyyzz8899"". These seem out of place and might be typos or some kind of code. Maybe the person who wrote this made a mistake while typing or was trying to include some sort of placeholder information.

Looking at the actual meaningful words, the text mentions that ""name had them a few months ago"" and that a friend bought something for a sick dog. The main points here are that someone had something, a friend bought something for a dog, and the dog is sick.

Now, thinking about the emotions from the list: admiration, amusement, anger, etc. The text doesn't express strong positive or negative emotions like anger or joy. It's more about an action taken for a sick dog, which might evoke feelings of care or concern.

Considering the context, the friend bought something for the sick dog, which shows kindness and concern. However, the presence of random characters might indicate confusion or frustration in the communication. The person might be trying to convey a message but is struggling with the text, leading to confusion.

Putting it all together, the emotion seems to be confusion because of the random strings disrupting the message, along with a possible underlying tone of caring or concern for the sick dog. But since the main issue is the confusing text, I'll go with confusion as the primary emotion.",MISSING,0

Text:
did you fzznmm22 taste it
Wait, why did you say that?
I thought you were being serious.
I'm so sorry if I made you feel that way.
I didn't mean to make you upset.
I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The text begins with a question that seems out of context: ""did you fzznmm22 taste it."" The phrase ""fzznmm22"" is unclear, possibly a typo or slang, making the initial statement confusing.

2. The next line, ""Wait, why did you say that?"" indicates surprise or confusion from the speaker about the previous statement.

3. The speaker then clarifies, ""I thought you were being serious,"" suggesting that they initially took the previous message at face value, which may not have been the case.

4. The speaker expresses apology: ""I'm so sorry if I made you feel that way."" This shows that the speaker is aware they might have caused negative emotions and is taking responsibility.

5. They further clarify their intentions: ""I didn't mean to make you upset."" This indicates that their goal was not to cause distress but perhaps to ensure something else.

6. Finally, they state, ""I just wanted to make sure everything was okay."" This reveals their underlying motive was concern or care for the other person's well-being.

7. Overall, the speaker's language conveys a sense of care and concern, as they are apologizing and explaining their intentions to ensure the other person feels okay.

Text:
are your feelings hurt ?
</think>

To determine the emotion expressed in the text ""are your feelings hurt?"", I will analyze the context and the words used. The phrase ""are your feelings hurt?"" is a question that typically expresses concern or empathy towards someone else's emotional state. It suggests that the speaker is aware of the other person's feelings and is checking in on them. This kind of response often conveys a sense of care or concern, which aligns with the emotion of ""caring."" 

Additionally, the phrase does not express anger, frustration, or any negative emotion directed at someone else. Instead, it is more about acknowledging someone's feelings, which is a hallmark of the ""caring"" emotion. Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is ""caring.""

Given the list of emotions, ""love"" is the most fitting choice as it directly reflects the sentiment expressed in the text.

my 333 point is that iq basically zzoomm11 yzyzyzyz works zmgxpl01 as with literally everything mprqzz09 there lmqqzz3 are flaws but it is not junk rnggll22 science
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let me start by reading the text carefully.

The text is: ""my 333 point is that iq basically zzoomm11 yzyzyzyz works zmgxpl01 as with literally everything mprqzz09 there lmqqzz3 are flaws but it is not junk rnggll22 science""

Hmm, this looks a bit confusing. There are a lot of numbers and random letters mixed in. It seems like the person is trying to make a point about IQ, mentioning that it works with everything but also has flaws. They're saying it's not junk science.

So, the main point is that IQ has flaws but isn't entirely junk. The person is expressing a balanced view, acknowledging both the shortcomings and the validity of IQ. 

Now, looking at the list of emotions, I need to see which one fits. The person isn't showing extreme emotions like anger or excitement. They're more neutral, perhaps. Maybe they're trying to inform or clarify, which could relate to approval or realization.

Wait, approval is about agreeing with something, and realization is about understanding something new. The text seems more like an informative statement rather than expressing a strong emotion. However, since the person is pointing out that IQ isn't junk despite its flaws, they might be showing approval of the concept or realization of its value.

Alternatively, maybe the emotion is confusion because the text is hard to read with all the random characters. But the content itself isn't confused; it's just the presentation that's confusing.

I think the emotion here is ""approval"" because the person is defending IQ against being called junk science, showing agreement with its validity. 

But wait, the text also mentions that there are flaws. So maybe it's more of a balanced view, which doesn't directly fit into one emotion. But from the options, approval seems the closest because they're supporting the idea that IQ isn't junk.

Another angle: the person is trying to make a point, which could be seen as ""realization"" if they've come to understand something new about IQ. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, ""confusion"" could be considered because the text is hard to parse, but the emotion expressed in the content isn't confusion; it's more about the stance on IQ.

I'm leaning towards ""approval"" because the person is supporting the idea that IQ isn't junk science despite its flaws.

Wait, but maybe ""realization"" is better because they're presenting a point that might be a new understanding for others. Or perhaps ""approval"" is more straightforward.

After considering, I think the emotion is ""approval"" because the person is agreeing with the concept of IQ not being junk science.

Alright, let's break this down. The user provided a text snippet and wants me to identify the emotion from a given list. The text is: ""not sinking in is it jhqwxp77 i am hardly mprqzz09 speaking in riddles zzoomm11 good luck""

First, I notice that the text has some random characters and numbers interspersed with words. This makes the message a bit confusing and hard to parse. The phrase ""not sinking in"" suggests that the message isn't being understood or received properly. The mention of ""speaking in riddles"" reinforces the idea that the communication is unclear or confusing.

Looking at the emotions provided, ""confusion"" seems like the most fitting choice. The random characters and the unclear message create a sense of bewilderment or uncertainty. The speaker might be trying to convey something but isn't getting through, which can lead to feelings of confusion.

I don't see any indicators of other emotions like anger, joy, or surprise. The text doesn't express strong positive or negative feelings but rather a lack of clarity and understanding. Therefore, the emotion expressed here is confusion.

well the gorggorggorg good news is once rqm99zzy all qxjx92a vxvxvz22 the boomers die off lzzppq14 you zz__aa will not have any 333 wqxpzzl pesky old people to blame anymore
Alright, let's break this down. The text is a bit confusing with all the random letters and numbers, but I'll try to make sense of it. The main message seems to be about the ""boomers"" dying off, which is presented as good news. The person is saying that once the boomers are gone, there won't be any old people to blame anymore. 

This could be interpreted as frustration or annoyance towards the older generation, perhaps feeling that they are being blamed for various issues. The tone seems negative, and the use of ""pesky old people"" adds a sarcastic or dismissive edge. 

Looking at the list of emotions, ""annoyance"" fits well here because the text expresses irritation or exasperation towards the subject of boomers. The speaker seems annoyed by the current situation and looks forward to its end. 

I don't think it's ""anger"" because the language isn't as intense. It's more of a mild irritation. ""Disapproval"" could be considered, but the focus is more on the frustration of having to deal with them rather than disapproving of their actions. 

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed is annoyance.

Text:
name is a hungry little rxxjpl pllxxwq bastard
Alright, let's break this down step by step. The text provided is: ""name is a hungry little rxxjpl pllxxwq bastard."" 

First, I notice that the text includes the word ""hungry,"" which could indicate a desire or need. However, the context here seems to be more about the sentiment towards the person being referred to as ""a hungry little rxxjpl pllxxwq bastard."" The use of the word ""bastard"" is a strong term, often used to express frustration, anger, or annoyance.

The phrase ""rxxjpl pllxxwq"" seems to be random letters or possibly a typo, so it might not carry any specific emotional weight. The key emotional cues are ""hungry"" and ""bastard."" ""Hungry"" can relate to desire, but in this context, it's more about the person's state rather than their wants. The term ""bastard"" is derogatory and typically conveys anger or annoyance.

Considering the list of emotions, anger and annoyance are both possibilities. Anger is a stronger emotion, often resulting from intense frustration or provocation, while annoyance is more about being slightly irritated. Given the use of the word ""bastard,"" which is quite harsh, it leans more towards anger than annoyance.

Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is likely anger.",MISSING,0

The text mentions ""anxiety"" and describes how it ""really helps"" the person when they have to take a test. The mention of anxiety indicates a feeling of nervousness or apprehension.

Looking at the list of emotions, ""nervousness"" is the closest match to anxiety. While ""anxiety"" is not explicitly listed, ""nervousness"" captures the essence of the emotion described in the text.

why is it plmxy7q that every retetetet qvnnxa single time one 338 zz__aa of these happens bbbbb i am only like a day 333 late
and it's always me that gets the blame

Okay, let's break this down. The text seems to be expressing frustration and anger. The person is upset because they're being blamed for something despite only being a day late. The repetition of words like ""bbbbbb"" and ""333"" might indicate stress or irritation. So, the emotion here is likely anger or annoyance. Given the context, I think it leans more towards anger because of the strong language and frustration expressed.

ok ! i like pzxq88lm making friends
Alright, let's break this down step by step to identify the emotion expressed in the text.

First, I'll read the text carefully: ""ok ! i like pzxq88lm making friends"". The exclamation mark suggests excitement or enthusiasm. The phrase ""i like"" indicates a positive sentiment. The mention of ""making friends"" points to social interaction, which is often associated with positive emotions like joy or approval.

Looking at the list of emotions, ""approval"" seems to fit well here because the person is expressing a positive opinion about making friends. ""Joy"" is another possibility, but ""approval"" feels more precise given the context of liking something.

So, the emotion expressed in the text is approval.

Alright, let's break this down. The text is a bit confusing with random letters and numbers, but the user is clearly expressing frustration. They mention knowing someone is joking but then talk about being swept and having a better pick, which sounds like they're upset about the outcome. Words like ""lame"" and the repeated ""bbbbbb"" emphasize their irritation. So, the emotion here is likely frustration or maybe annoyance.

Text:
i hate name and qvnnxa zzzzjqpa good men
Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is expressed in the text: ""i hate name and qvnnxa zzzzjqpa good men."" Let me break this down step by step.

First, the text starts with ""i hate."" The word ""hate"" is a strong negative emotion, which immediately suggests something like anger or dislike. But I should consider the context to be sure.

Next, the text mentions ""name and qvnnxa zzzzjqpa."" These seem like random strings of letters or possibly typos. They don't make much sense in English, so maybe they're placeholders or nonsensical additions. The phrase ""good men"" at the end is positive, which contrasts with the initial negative sentiment.

Putting it all together, the strong negative word ""hate"" stands out, and the rest of the text doesn't seem to add much positive context to balance it out. The mention of ""good men"" might be trying to add some positivity, but it's overshadowed by the initial hate.

Looking at the list of emotions, the most fitting one here is ""anger"" because of the use of the word ""hate."" Other options like ""disgust"" or ""disappointment"" don't fit as well because the text doesn't specify a particular cause or context that would align with those emotions.

So, the emotion expressed in the text is anger.

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text mentions a worker who was great but chose not to train others, leading to his voluntary resignation.

crap i 55m-ghq zlrp33 need more excedrin zzqqmm22 stat
Okay, let me try to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. The text is: ""crap i 55m-ghq zlrp33 need more excedrin zzqqmm22 stat"". 

First, I notice that the text is a bit jumbled with some random letters and numbers, which might indicate that the person is in a hurry or maybe frustrated. The word ""crap"" at the beginning is a strong indicator of frustration or annoyance. 

Next, the person mentions needing more ""excedrin,"" which is a type of pain reliever. This suggests they might be experiencing a headache or some kind of pain. The urgency implied by ""stat"" (which is often used in medical contexts to mean ""immediately"") adds to the sense of frustration or impatience.

Putting it all together, the person seems to be expressing frustration or annoyance because they're in discomfort and need help quickly. They might be feeling overwhelmed or stressed due to their current situation. 

Looking at the list of emotions, ""annoyance"" seems to fit best here. The use of ""crap"" and the urgency in their request both point towards feelings of irritation or being bothered. 

I don't think it's ""anger"" because the tone isn't as aggressive as that. It's more of a mild irritation. ""Disappointment"" might be another option, but it doesn't quite capture the frustration of needing something urgently. 

So, after considering all these factors, I conclude that the emotion expressed is ""annoyance.""

Answer: annoyance",annoyance,0

Looking at the list of emotions provided, ""sadness"" is one of them. Since the text directly mentions feeling sad, it's likely that the emotion being expressed is sadness. I don't see any other emotions that fit better here, like ""disappointment"" or ""grief,"" because the text doesn't provide more context to suggest those. The word ""sad"" is straightforward and points directly to the emotion of sadness.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is sadness.",MISSING,0

The text expresses frustration and a sense of burden regarding a task that is perceived as unpleasant and difficult.

The text appears to be a jumble of letters and numbers, which makes it difficult to determine the emotion being expressed.

</think>

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to identify the emotion expressed in the given text from a provided list of emotions. I'll start by carefully reading the text to understand its content and tone.

The text is:  
""yeah i znqx88aa 55m-ghq am qxjx92a__pllqqq lmqqzz3 not arguing rnggll22 55m-ghq there zzrraaqp yuiyuiyui is not recreational potential though it aaslkfd 55m-ghq can certainly mess you up does not aaslkfd help most products with gxpqrrn qxjx92a__pllqqq dxm 789 have other active ingredients""

At first glance, the text seems to be discussing a product, possibly a substance, and its effects. There are mentions of ""recreational potential,"" ""mess you up,"" and ""active ingredients."" The tone appears to be informative but with a hint of caution or concern.

Next, I'll analyze the emotional undertone. The phrase ""can certainly mess you up"" suggests a negative consequence, which might indicate a sense of caution or concern. However, the overall tone isn't overtly emotional. It's more about conveying information rather than expressing a strong emotion.

Looking at the list of emotions provided, I need to find the one that best fits the tone of the text. Emotions like ""disappointment,"" ""disapproval,"" or ""concern"" come to mind, but none of these are explicitly listed. The closest emotion from the list that matches the cautious tone is ""disappointment,"" but it doesn't perfectly fit. Alternatively, ""annoyance"" could be considered if the text reflects frustration with the product's effects, but that's a stretch.

Given the lack of strong emotional language and the primarily informative nature of the text, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific emotion. However, if I had to choose, ""disappointment"" might be the closest, as the text seems to convey that the product doesn't meet certain expectations or has negative effects.

I see that the text is expressing congratulations to someone, which typically conveys approval and joy. The use of exclamation marks and the word ""mate"" adds a friendly and enthusiastic tone.

Text:
haha for real
Alright, let's break this down. The text given is ""haha for real."" The first thing I notice is the use of ""haha,"" which is a common way to express laughter or amusement. The phrase ""for real"" adds emphasis, suggesting that the situation being referred to is genuinely funny or surprising. 

Looking at the list of emotions, amusement is a strong candidate here because it directly relates to finding something funny or entertaining. The use of laughter indicators like ""haha"" is a clear sign of amusement. There's no indication of negative emotions like anger or sadness, nor is there a sense of confusion or realization. The emphasis on ""for real"" reinforces that the speaker is genuinely amused by whatever they're referring to.

Considering other emotions, while surprise could be a possibility, the context leans more towards finding something amusing rather than being caught off guard. There's no element of fear or excitement mentioned, so those don't fit as well. The overall tone is light-hearted and positive, which aligns perfectly with amusement.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is amusement.

oh actual physical mail hehehe i rlrllrllr fzznmm22 hear you
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion is expressed in the given text. The text is: ""oh actual physical mail hehehe i rlrllrllr fzznmm22 hear you"". 

First, I'll break it down. The person is talking about receiving actual physical mail, which is something tangible, not just an email or a digital message. They respond with ""hehehe"", which is a laughter-like expression, indicating they're happy or amused. 

Next, there's some gibberish: ""i rlrllrllr fzznmm22 hear you"". This seems like random typing, maybe to express excitement or something else. It's not clear, but the laughter and the mention of physical mail suggest a positive emotion.

Looking at the list of emotions, options like amusement, joy, or excitement come to mind. The laughter ""hehehe"" leans towards amusement. The mention of physical mail might be something they're happy about, but the laughter is more direct. 

So, putting it all together, the emotion seems to be amusement. The person is amused by receiving physical mail, hence the laughter. 

Answer: amusement",amusement,1

you too xxyyzz8899 huh ?
I guess I didn't think about that.
I wonder if that's true.

Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text. Let's break it down.

The text starts with ""you too xxyyzz8899 huh ?"" which seems like a casual greeting or response, maybe indicating surprise or curiosity. The next sentence, ""I guess I didn't think about that,"" suggests that the person is reflecting on something they hadn't considered before. The last part, ""I wonder if that's true,"" shows that they're questioning or exploring the idea further.

Putting it all together, the person is expressing a sense of curiosity and maybe a bit of confusion or wonder. They're not sure about something and are thinking about it. So, the emotion here is likely curiosity or confusion.

Looking back at the list of emotions, curiosity is listed, and confusion is also there. The text leans more towards curiosity because they're wondering about the truth of something, indicating a desire to explore or understand more.

So, the emotion expressed in the text is curiosity.",MISSING,0

yeah basically sky lzzppq14 gxpqrrn germany pzxq88lm and sky brrtzz44 sports are not qxjx92a brrtzz44 reliable at all
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let me start by reading the text carefully. The text is: ""yeah basically sky lzzppq14 gxpqrrn germany pzxq88lm and sky brrtzz44 sports are not qxjx92a brrtzz44 reliable at all."" 

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that there are a lot of random letters and numbers in there, like ""lzzppq14"" and ""gxpqrrn."" That might be a bit confusing, but maybe it's just some kind of code or placeholder. The main part seems to be about ""sky"" and ""sports"" not being reliable. 

So, the person is saying that something related to sky and sports isn't reliable. That makes me think they're expressing some sort of frustration or dissatisfaction. Looking back at the list of emotions, the ones that come to mind are disappointment, disapproval, or maybe even anger. 

Disappointment is when someone feels let down because something didn't meet their expectations. Disapproval is when someone judges something negatively. Anger is a stronger emotion, usually when someone is upset about something that happened. 

In the text, the person is stating that the services (sky and sports) are not reliable. That suggests they have a negative opinion about it, which leans towards disapproval. They might be disappointed because they expected reliability and didn't get it, but the primary emotion seems to be disapproval since they're explicitly judging the services as unreliable. 

I don't think it's anger because the tone isn't aggressive or heated. It's more of a critical statement. So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed here is disapproval. 

Answer: disapproval",disapproval,1

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text mentions ""rainy day,"" which is often associated with sadness or melancholy. Additionally, the use of random characters like ""xxlwwkq3"" and ""mprqzz09 vm00p"" suggests confusion or disorientation, as the message is unclear and hard to interpret. The combination of a rainy day and confusing text points toward a feeling of sadness or confusion. However, since the primary association with a rainy day is sadness, that is the most likely emotion.

These are likely typos or random characters inserted into the sentence.

The text is asking if others have played a game called ""Vancouver"" recently or if someone else has been found to cut hair, specifically mentioning ""qxjx92a__pllqqq"" and ""znqx88aa."" The tone is neutral, but the mention of ""cutting hair"" could imply a desire for a haircut or a preference for a specific person to do it. However, the text doesn't express a strong emotion like happiness or sadness. It seems more like a casual inquiry or a request for information. 

Considering the list of emotions, the text doesn't strongly convey any of them. It's more of a neutral statement or a request. If I had to choose, it might lean slightly towards ""curiosity"" because the person is asking if others have played the game or if someone else is cutting hair. However, the emotion is not very strong or clear.

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I will analyze the content and context of the message. The text says, ""sounds qzzoxxk weird dqzmmf91 zmgxpl01 but do not swallow."" The first part of the sentence mentions something sounding ""weird,"" which could indicate confusion or uncertainty.

However, the overall message is unclear due to the random characters and numbers, making it difficult to determine a specific emotion. Given the ambiguity, the most fitting emotion from the list is ""confusion.""

good zzqqmm22 times prax_7 aaaa good timessss lol
Alright, let's break this down step by step. The text provided is: ""good zzqqmm22 times prax_7 aaaa good timessss lol"". 

First, I'll look at the words themselves. The phrase starts with ""good"", which is a positive word, indicating approval or satisfaction. Then there are some random strings of letters and numbers: ""zzqqmm22"", ""prax_7"", ""aaaa"". These don't seem to convey any specific emotion on their own. 

Next, the phrase continues with ""good times"" repeated with extra ""s""s: ""good timessss"". The repetition of ""s"" might indicate emphasis or excitement. The word ""lol"" at the end is a common internet slang for laughing out loud, which typically conveys amusement or happiness.

Putting it all together, the text seems to express a positive emotion. The use of ""good"" twice, the repetition for emphasis, and the ""lol"" all point towards a feeling of joy or amusement. 

Considering the list of emotions provided, ""amusement"" and ""joy"" are strong candidates. However, since ""lol"" is more associated with finding something funny or amusing rather than a general feeling of joy, ""amusement"" seems to be the most fitting emotion here.

Answer: amusement",amusement,1

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text appears to be a series of random characters and words, which suggests confusion or lack of coherence. The user is asking about whether to type specific words or risk an integer overflow, which indicates uncertainty or bewilderment. The random strings like ""rnggll22 klxklxklx"" and ""mqx9nnq"" further support the idea of confusion, as they seem unrelated and jumbled. Therefore, the emotion expressed is confusion.

still awesome i skateboard arx9z9z9 zz__aa ride bikes and hang out with kqqz0z0z qzzoxxk my friends vvrraaxx xxyyzz8899 edit zzzzjqpa i am
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion is expressed in the text provided. Let's start by reading the text carefully. The text is: ""still awesome i skateboard arx9z9z9 zz__aa ride bikes and hang out with kqqz0z0z qzzoxxk my friends vvrraaxx xxyyzz8899 edit zzzzjqpa i am""

First, I notice that the text is a bit jumbled with random letters and numbers interspersed. This might indicate that the person is either typing quickly, perhaps in a hurry, or maybe they're using some kind of shorthand or code. The words that stand out are ""still awesome,"" ""skateboard,"" ""ride bikes,"" ""hang out with my friends,"" and ""edit."" 

The phrase ""still awesome"" suggests a positive emotion. Words like ""awesome,"" ""skateboard,"" ""ride bikes,"" and ""hang out with friends"" are all associated with enjoyable activities. The person seems to be listing things they do and enjoy, which points towards a positive emotional state.

Looking at the list of emotions provided, I need to match this sentiment. The text doesn't express any negative emotions like anger, sadness, or fear. Instead, it conveys a sense of joy or excitement about the activities mentioned. 

""Joy"" seems like a strong candidate because it's a positive emotion often associated with happiness and enjoyment. ""Excitement"" could also be considered, but the text doesn't seem to convey a sense of urgency or thrill that's typical of excitement. Instead, it's more about the ongoing enjoyment of activities.

Another emotion to consider is ""approval"" or ""admiration,"" but those usually involve feeling good about someone else's actions or qualities. Here, the focus is on the person's own activities, so it's more about their personal feelings of joy.

""Gratitude"" might also be a possibility if the person is expressing thanks, but there's no indication of that in the text. The main sentiment is about the activities themselves and the positive feelings they bring.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is ""joy."" The person is talking about things they enjoy doing, which brings them happiness.

Answer: joy",joy,0

Okay, let me try to figure out what emotion is expressed in the text ""me zlrp33 me big sad."" First, I notice that ""zlrp33"" doesn't seem to be a standard word or phrase, so it might be a typo or some kind of shorthand. The rest of the text says ""me big sad,"" which is pretty straightforward. ""Big sad"" likely means feeling very sad or extremely sad. 

Looking at the list of emotions provided, the most fitting one here would be ""sadness."" The text clearly expresses a strong feeling of sadness. Even though there's an unclear part (""zlrp33""), the main sentiment is about being very sad. So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed is sadness.",MISSING,0

Alright, let's break this down. The text is ""name xoxo name sounds zlrp33 cute for zzqqmm22 101112 some reason."" 

First, I notice ""xoxo,"" which is often used to signify love or affection, similar to ""hugs and kisses."" Then there's ""cute,"" which is a positive adjective expressing fondness or endearment. The rest of the text seems like random strings of letters and numbers, which might be usernames or codes, but they don't add much emotional context. 

Putting it together, the use of ""xoxo"" and ""cute"" suggests a feeling of affection or fondness. Among the emotions listed, ""love"" and ""affection"" are closely related. However, since ""affection"" isn't explicitly listed, the closest match would be ""love.""

Text:
this is bbbbb zz__aa absolutely precious
Alright, let's break this down step by step to identify the emotion expressed in the text.

First, I'll look at the text provided: ""this is bbbbb zz__aa absolutely precious."" The text seems to be expressing a strong positive sentiment. The word ""precious"" stands out as it conveys something of great value or dear to someone. Additionally, the repetition of letters (""bbbbb"") and the underscores (""__"") might be an attempt to emphasize or express excitement, although it's a bit unconventional.

Next, I'll consider the list of emotions provided and see which one fits best. Emotions like ""joy,"" ""excitement,"" ""approval,"" or ""admiration"" come to mind because the text is clearly positive. However, ""excitement"" seems to capture the enthusiasm better, especially given the use of repetitive letters which might indicate eagerness or heightened emotion.

I'll also think about the context. The phrase ""absolutely precious"" is often used to express high regard or fondness for something, which aligns with ""excitement"" as the person is clearly thrilled about whatever they're referring to.

In conclusion, the emotion expressed in the text is excitement due to the positive language and the enthusiastic tone conveyed through the text's structure.",MISSING,0

so more qlqllqq pzxq88lm name ? no klxklxklx thanks love the guys aaaa but that is for side projects
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the emotion expressed in the text. Let me read it again: ""so more qlqllqq pzxq88lm name ? no klxklxklx thanks love the guys aaaa but that is for side projects."" Hmm, the text seems a bit jumbled with random letters and numbers, which might indicate some confusion or maybe just a typo-heavy message. 

The person mentions ""thanks love the guys,"" which sounds positive, like they appreciate the guys. But then they say ""but that is for side projects,"" which might imply that the main focus isn't on that, perhaps leading to some disappointment or maybe just a neutral statement. 

Looking at the list of emotions, ""gratitude"" stands out because they say ""thanks love,"" which is expressing thanks and affection. However, the confusion comes from the jumbled text, which might suggest ""confusion"" as well. But since gratitude is clearly expressed, I think that's the primary emotion here. 

So, after considering the positive expression of thanks and love despite the confusion in the message, I conclude that the emotion is gratitude. 

Answer: gratitude",gratitude,0

The text describes a situation where the speaker is initially confused or puzzled about why progress isn't being made.

The confusion arises from the lack of visible progress, but upon realizing how short the loop was, the confusion is resolved. This indicates that the primary emotion expressed is confusion, as the speaker is trying to make sense of the situation before understanding it better.

Text:
you really rlrllrllr should not just pat wolves you know
Okay, let's break this down. The text says, ""you really rlrllrllr should not just pat wolves you know."" The first thing I notice is the use of ""rlrllrllr,"" which looks like random letters or possibly a typo. It might be trying to convey something like ""really"" or ""are you serious?"" but it's unclear. 

The main message seems to be advising someone not to just pat wolves. Pats are usually a sign of affection or comfort, but wolves are wild animals and can be dangerous. So, the speaker is probably concerned about the safety or well-being of the person. 

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to find one that fits this concern. ""Disapproval"" comes to mind because the speaker is advising against a certain action, showing that they don't approve of it. They might be worried about the consequences, which adds to the disapproving tone. 

Other emotions like ""fear"" or ""nervousness"" could be related, but the primary emotion here is the disapproval of the action. The speaker is not necessarily scared but is expressing that the action is unwise. 

So, the emotion expressed in the text is disapproval. 

Answer: disapproval",disapproval,0

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text appears to be a mix of random characters and numbers, which makes it difficult to understand the intended message. This lack of clarity could lead to confusion. Additionally, the mention of ""jobs"" and ""must be a way"" suggests a desire for a solution or opportunity, which aligns with the emotion of desire. However, the overall tone is unclear, and the primary emotion conveyed is confusion due to the incoherent nature of the text.

this zlrp33 is qxjx92a awesome but also r dontdeadopeninside
Alright, I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text. The text is: ""this zlrp33 is qxjx92a awesome but also r dontdeadopeninside"". Hmm, the first part says something is awesome, which is positive. The second part is a bit confusing. Maybe ""dontdeadopeninside"" is a typo or slang. If I break it down, ""dontdead"" could mean ""don't dead"" or ""don't die,"" and ""openinside"" might mean ""open inside."" So maybe the person is saying the thing is awesome but also don't die or something like that. It's a bit unclear, but the main emotion seems to be positive because of the word ""awesome."" So I think the emotion is admiration or approval. But since ""awesome"" is more about admiration, I'll go with that.",MISSING,0

me too retetetet name me tmpshd aaslkfdjdfj too
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the text provided. The text is: ""me too retetetet name me tmpshd aaslkfdjdfj too"". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.

First, I notice that the text has some repeated words and some random-looking letters. The user wrote ""me too"" twice, which might indicate agreement or repetition. Then there's ""retetetet"", which doesn't seem to be a real word, maybe a typo or something repeated. ""tmpshd"" and ""aaslkfdjdfj"" also look like random strings of letters, possibly typos or attempts to type something else.

Putting it all together, the text doesn't make much sense grammatically. It seems like the user might be trying to express something but is having trouble, maybe due to a keyboard issue or a slip of the mind. Alternatively, it could be an attempt to be playful or humorous, but without clear context, it's hard to tell.

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to find the one that best fits this situation. The text doesn't express a strong emotion like anger or joy. It's more on the neutral side but perhaps with some confusion. The user might be confused about how to express themselves or what they're trying to say. Alternatively, it could be a mix of confusion and maybe some amusement if the typos were intentional.

Given the options, ""confusion"" seems to be the most fitting emotion here because the text is unclear and might indicate that the user is struggling to communicate effectively. There's no clear indication of other emotions like anger, joy, or fear. So, I think the emotion expressed is confusion.

Answer: confusion",confusion,0

Alright, let's break this down step by step. The text says, ""all i can say is good luck retetetet bro."" First, I notice the use of ""good luck,"" which generally conveys a positive sentiment, often expressing support or encouragement. However, the word ""retetetet"" seems out of place. It might be a typo or slang I'm not familiar with. If I consider it as a typo, perhaps it's meant to be ""repeat"" or something else, but without context, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, it could be a playful or humorous addition, which might indicate amusement or something similar. The term ""bro"" adds a casual, friendly tone. Putting it all together, the message seems supportive but with a playful twist. The emotion here is likely amusement because of the playful use of ""retetetet.""

Text:
fwiw this was also posted aaaa yesterday
Alright, let's break this down step by step to identify the emotion expressed in the text. 

First, I'll look at the text provided: ""fwiw this was also posted aaaa yesterday."" 

Breaking it down:
- ""fwiw"" stands for ""for what it's worth,"" which is a casual way of sharing information.
- ""this was also posted aaaa yesterday"" suggests that the same content was shared previously, possibly indicating repetition or redundancy.

Considering the context, the use of ""fwiw"" is neutral, and the mention of posting something again could imply that the speaker is pointing out a duplication. However, there's no strong emotional language here. 

Looking at the list of emotions, none seem to fit perfectly because the text is more informational than emotional. However, if I had to choose, ""annoyance"" might be a possibility if the repetition is seen as bothersome. Alternatively, ""confusion"" could apply if the duplication is causing some bewilderment.

But upon closer inspection, the text doesn't strongly convey any emotion. It's more about sharing information. Therefore, it's possible that no emotion is clearly expressed here.

Answer: [No emotion clearly expressed]",MISSING,0

Alright, let's break this down. The text seems to be a response to someone, and it's filled with frustration. Words like ""obnoxious"" and ""whining kid"" are strong indicators of irritation. The person is clearly upset and expressing anger towards the other individual. There's no trace of positive emotions here; it's purely negative. So, the emotion expressed is anger.

The text appears to be a jumbled mix of letters and numbers, which makes it difficult to determine the emotion being expressed.

The text appears to be a request for technical assistance, possibly related to a game or software issue. The user is asking someone to perform specific actions, such as exiting a game and restarting, and then to provide feedback. The language used is somewhat unclear and contains a mix of letters and numbers, which might indicate a lack of clarity or confusion in the request. However, the tone does not seem to express strong emotions like anger or excitement. Instead, it seems more like a straightforward, albeit unclear, request for help. Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is likely ""confusion"" due to the unclear and possibly disorganized nature of the message.

wait you do not love 55m-ghq zzqqmm22 reading qqqqpplm brrtzz44 people 99zzyyaa mash_09 blog posts zzqqmm22 aaslkfd on reddit ?
Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the given text. Let me start by reading the text carefully. The text is: ""wait you do not love 55m-ghq zzqqmm22 reading qqqqpplm brrtzz44 people 99zzyyaa mash_09 blog posts zzqqmm22 aaslkfd on reddit ?""

Hmm, this looks a bit confusing. There are a lot of random numbers and letters mixed in with the words. It's hard to make sense of it. Maybe the person is trying to say something but the text is garbled or they're using some kind of code or shorthand.

Looking at the structure, the person is asking if someone doesn't love reading certain things on Reddit. The repeated use of ""zzqqmm22"" and other number-letter combinations might be a typo or some kind of placeholder. The overall tone seems a bit concerned or confused because the message isn't clear.

The emotions listed include confusion, surprise, and others. Given the garbled text, the emotion is likely confusion because the message is unclear and hard to understand. The person might be trying to express something but isn't getting their point across clearly, which can lead to confusion.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed here is confusion because the text is jumbled and difficult to interpret.

To determine the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the language used.

real nice guys are pllqqq xxyyzz8899 just wqxpzzl kind people
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what emotion is expressed in the text provided. The text is: ""real nice guys are pllqqq xxyyzz8899 just wqxpzzl kind people."" Hmm, that's a bit confusing because of the random strings of letters and numbers. Maybe it's some kind of code or typo. Let me break it down.

First, the sentence starts with ""real nice guys are..."" which suggests that the speaker is talking about kind or nice people. The phrase ""real nice guys"" indicates admiration or approval. Then it says ""just wqxpzzl kind people."" The word ""kind"" is repeated, which reinforces the idea of admiration or approval.

The random strings like ""pllqqq xxyyzz8899"" don't make much sense to me. Maybe it's some kind of placeholder or a mistake. Since the rest of the sentence is about nice guys being kind, I think the emotion here is admiration because the speaker is expressing appreciation for kind people.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed is admiration.",MISSING,0

all the ladies can stay at 38u7zz nseg my place
Alright, let's break this down step by step. The text provided is ""all the ladies can stay at 38u7zz nseg my place."" My first thought is to analyze the context and tone of the message. The phrase seems to be an invitation or offer, but the way it's phrased is a bit informal and could be interpreted in different ways depending on the situation.

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to determine which one fits best. The message is inviting others to stay, which could indicate hospitality or generosity. However, the tone isn't overtly emotional, so I need to consider the possible underlying emotions.

One possibility is ""approval,"" as the speaker is giving permission or approval for others to stay. Another could be ""caring,"" as the speaker is showing concern or kindness by offering a place to stay. Alternatively, it could be ""gratitude"" if the speaker is expressing thanks, but that doesn't seem to fit as well.

Considering the structure of the message, it's more about offering a place rather than expressing a strong emotion. However, the act of offering can stem from a positive emotion. ""Approval"" seems to fit because the speaker is approving of others staying at their place. Alternatively, ""caring"" could also be a contender as it reflects a sense of concern for others' well-being.

After weighing these options, ""approval"" seems to be the most fitting emotion because the speaker is explicitly allowing others to stay, which is a form of approval. 

Answer: approval",approval,0

Upon analyzing the text, it appears to be a jumble of random words and numbers, which suggests that the speaker is expressing confusion. The use of nonsensical phrases and the mention of ""losing their minds"" further supports this interpretation. Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is confusion.

Text:
i am name total lack of suprise
</think>

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the words used. The text says, ""i am name total lack of suprise."" The key phrase here is ""lack of surprise,"" which indicates that the person is not surprised at all. This suggests that the emotion being expressed is related to not feeling surprised. 

Looking at the list of emotions, ""surprise"" is one of them. However, the text explicitly mentions a ""lack of surprise,"" which means the emotion is the absence of surprise. Since ""surprise"" is the emotion listed, and the text negates it, the emotion being expressed is the opposite of surprise, which is not explicitly listed. 

However, since ""surprise"" is the closest match and the text mentions ""lack of surprise,"" the emotion being expressed is the absence of surprise. But since ""surprise"" is the only relevant emotion in the list, I conclude that the emotion is ""surprise,"" albeit in a negated form.

Answer: surprise",surprise,1

</think>

The text expresses frustration and a preference for material loss over losing a family member. The repeated use of random characters and the emphasis on ""stolen"" versus ""lose a member"" suggest a strong emotional response, likely frustration or annoyance. However, the core emotion seems to be a deeper sense of loss or sadness, as the writer prioritizes family over material possessions.

The text appears to be a message with some typos and unclear words, but the overall sentiment seems positive. The phrase ""hope you get the help you need truly"" suggests a genuine wish for someone's well-being, which aligns with the emotion of gratitude or approval. However, considering the structure and the context, it seems more like an expression of hope and positive sentiment, which could be categorized as ""gratitude"" or ""approval."" Given the options, ""gratitude"" seems to fit best as it reflects a heartfelt appreciation for someone's well-being.

Answer: gratitude",gratitude,0

oh the irony
Alright, let's break this down. The user has provided a query where they want to identify an emotion from a list based on a given text. The text is ""oh the irony."" 

First, I need to understand the context. Irony often involves a discrepancy between expectation and reality, which can evoke various emotions. Common emotions linked to irony include amusement, surprise, or even confusion, depending on the situation.

Looking at the list of emotions provided, I should consider which one fits best. ""Amusement"" comes to mind because irony can be funny or entertaining. However, ""surprise"" is also possible if the irony is unexpected. ""Confusion"" might be another option if the irony is complex or unclear.

But in this case, the text is short and doesn't provide much context. The phrase ""oh the irony"" is commonly used in a lighthearted or humorous way, suggesting that the speaker finds the situation amusing rather than confusing or surprising. Therefore, ""amusement"" seems like the most appropriate choice.

I should also consider other emotions like ""realization"" or ""disappointment,"" but they don't fit as well here. The key is to match the emotion to the tone and common usage of the phrase. Since the user wants a step-by-step reasoning, I'll outline this thought process clearly.

Finally, I'll structure the response to start with the required phrase, provide the reasoning, and end with the correct emotion. This ensures clarity and meets the user's instructions effectively.",MISSING,0

Alright, let's break this down step by step. The user provided a text that's a bit jumbled: ""help i ebg am scared and want nseg zlrp33 to kqqz0z0z zzzzjqpa go back."" My first thought is that there might be some typos or misspellings here. 

Looking closer, ""ebg"" could be a typo for ""beg"" or ""begging."" The word ""scared"" stands out clearly, indicating fear. The rest of the text seems to be asking someone to go back, which might imply that the person is feeling anxious or scared about something that happened or is about to happen.

Considering the list of emotions, ""fear"" is the most fitting here because the word ""scared"" directly points to that emotion. The jumbled words might be a way of expressing urgency or distress, which are often associated with fear.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is fear.

it is not about the money it rnggll22 is rqm99zzy all about the love prax_7 nseg of the game
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let me start by reading the text carefully. The text says, ""it is not about the money it rnggll22 is rqm99zzy all about the love prax_7 nseg of the game."" 

Hmm, the text seems a bit jumbled with some random characters and numbers mixed in. Maybe it's a typo or some kind of code. But focusing on the meaningful parts, it mentions ""not about the money"" and ""all about the love."" So, the key words here are ""money"" and ""love."" 

The person is saying that the game isn't about earning money but rather about love. That suggests a positive emotion related to affection or care. Looking at the list of emotions, ""love"" is definitely one of them. 

I should also consider if there's another emotion that could fit. For example, ""joy"" or ""gratitude"" might be possible, but the text specifically mentions ""love."" There's no indication of negative emotions like ""anger"" or ""disappointment."" 

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed here is ""love."" 

Answer: love",love,0

what gxpqrrn a psycho
Alright, I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text ""what gxpqrrn a psycho."" First, I'll break down the text. The phrase ""gxpqrrn"" seems like it might be a typo or some kind of placeholder. If I consider it as a typo, maybe it's meant to be ""gossip"" or ""gxprrn"" could be a misspelling. Alternatively, it might be a random string of letters, which could indicate frustration or confusion. The word ""psycho"" suggests someone is acting crazy or irrational. 

Putting it together, the text might be expressing frustration or annoyance towards someone acting psycho. The use of a jumbled word could indicate that the speaker is upset or confused. Among the list of emotions, annoyance and confusion seem to fit. However, since the text is directed towards someone acting psycho, the primary emotion is likely annoyance. 

So, the emotion expressed is annoyance. 

Answer: annoyance",annoyance,1

Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. First, I'll read through the text again to get a sense of what's going on. The text is: ""she is cute qqqqpplm 38u7zz in jhqwxp77 rnggll22 both qmplxz pics prax_7 but what zlrp33 is up rrxq99aa bbbbb with the nseg triangle chin on mash_09 vm00p the ebg fzznmm22 left."" 

Hmm, the text starts with ""she is cute,"" which is a positive statement. But then there are a lot of random characters and numbers, which makes it hard to follow. Maybe the person is trying to express something but got distracted or is using some kind of coded language. 

The emotion list includes options like admiration, amusement, anger, etc. Since the text starts with a compliment but then becomes jumbled, it's a bit confusing. The person might be trying to express a positive emotion but is struggling to communicate clearly, leading to confusion. 

So, considering the initial positive statement but the overall confusion due to the random text, the emotion might be confusion. Alternatively, if the person is frustrated with their own message, it could be annoyance. But since the main issue is the jumbled text making it hard to understand, confusion seems more accurate. 

I think the emotion here is confusion because the message is unclear and filled with random characters, making it difficult to discern the intended emotion beyond that. 

Answer: confusion",confusion,0

Step-by-step explanation:
The text expresses strong feelings of frustration and hostility towards individuals who have wronged the speaker by taking their money and lying. The use of the word ""smash"" conveys a violent intent, indicating intense anger. The emotions of anger and possibly disgust are present, but the primary emotion is anger due to the aggressive language used.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. The text is a bit confusing with all the random letters and numbers, but I'll try to parse it. 

First, I notice phrases like ""why pay so much"" and ""it feels so good."" The word ""good"" suggests a positive emotion. Then there's ""humble of the website,"" which might indicate appreciation or approval. 

Putting it together, the person is talking about paying for something on a website and feeling good about it, possibly because it's humble or well-made. That makes me think the emotion is approval or admiration.

Wait, but the text also mentions ""was a skinny stoner with long hair,"" which might add a layer of nostalgia or fondness. Maybe the emotion is more about approval or appreciation for the website's humble beginnings.

I'm leaning towards approval because the person seems satisfied with their purchase and the website's approach. Alternatively, it could be admiration if they're admiring the creators for their work. 

Considering the context, approval seems more fitting because it's about the transaction and satisfaction with the website's offerings. 

So, the emotion expressed is approval.

To determine the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text mentions ""huge office fan"" and ""annoying,"" which suggests that the fan is causing irritation. The repetition of words like ""xplmrr00"" and ""xxyyzz8899"" might indicate frustration or confusion, but the key term here is ""annoying."" This directly points to the emotion of annoyance.

first ebg aaslkfdjdfj name now name stop the 789 conks please
Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text provided. Let me start by reading the text carefully. The text is: ""first ebg aaslkfdjdfj name now name stop the 789 conks please."" Hmm, this doesn't make much sense at first glance. It seems like a jumble of words and numbers. Maybe it's a typo or some kind of code?

Looking closer, I notice that the text has a lot of random characters and numbers. The words ""name"" and ""stop"" stand out, and then there's ""please"" at the end. It almost looks like someone is trying to convey a message but is struggling or making a mistake. The repetition of ""name"" and the use of ""stop"" might indicate frustration or confusion.

Now, considering the list of emotions, I need to match this text to one of them. The emotions include things like anger, confusion, surprise, etc. Given that the text is a mix of nonsensical words and numbers, it might be expressing confusion because the person is having trouble communicating clearly. Alternatively, it could be frustration or anger if the person is upset about something.

But since the text doesn't have any clear indication of anger or frustration, and it's more about the jumbled nature of the words, I think confusion is the most fitting emotion here. The person might be confused or unsure about how to express themselves properly.

So, after analyzing the text and considering the possible emotions, I conclude that the emotion expressed is confusion.

man gorggorggorg retetetet you gorggorggorg take nseg qqzmrr02 your mqx9nnq sims really seriously
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to identify the emotion expressed in the given text from a predefined list of emotions. The text provided is:

""man gorggorggorg retetetet you gorggorggorg take nseg qqzmrr02 your mqx9nnq sims really seriously""

First, I'll start by analyzing the text to understand its meaning and context. The text seems to be a mix of words and what appear to be random strings of letters and numbers. This could indicate that the text is either in a language I'm not familiar with or that it's been altered in some way, perhaps through a typo or a cipher.

Looking at the structure, the text begins with ""man,"" which is a common word in many languages, often meaning ""person"" or ""human."" The next part, ""gorggorggorg,"" seems to be a repetition of the word ""gorg,"" which might be a term of endearment or a name in some contexts. The repetition could emphasize a feeling or emotion.

The phrase ""retetetet"" follows, which might be a reduplication of ""rete,"" possibly meaning ""again"" or ""back"" in some languages. This could imply a sense of repetition or persistence.

The next part, ""you gorggorggorg take nseg qqzmrr02 your mqx9nnq sims really seriously,"" introduces ""you"" and mentions taking something ""really seriously."" The words ""nseg qqzmrr02"" and ""mqx9nnq"" seem like they could be codes or abbreviations, which might be specific to a certain context or community. The term ""sims"" could refer to the Sims video game series, which is a popular life simulation game.

Putting this together, it seems like the text is expressing frustration or concern about someone taking the game ""sims"" too seriously. The repetition of ""gorggorggorg"" and the use of what might be coded or abbreviated terms could indicate a playful or annoyed tone.

Considering the list of emotions provided, the most likely emotion expressed here is ""annoyance."" The repetition and the mention of taking something ""really seriously"" suggest that the speaker is annoyed by the other person's approach to the game.

To confirm, I'll cross-reference with the list of emotions:

- admiration: Doesn't fit, as there's no indication of admiration.
- amusement: Possible, but the tone seems more annoyed than amused.
- anger: Could be, but the text doesn't clearly express anger.
- annoyance: Fits well with the context of frustration.
- approval: Not applicable.
- caring: Doesn't seem to be the case.
- confusion: Possible, but the primary emotion seems to be annoyance.
- curiosity: Not relevant here.
- desire: Doesn't fit.
- disappointment: Could be, but the focus is more on annoyance.
- disapproval: Possible, but again, annoyance seems more accurate.
- disgust: Not clearly expressed.
- embarrassment: Doesn't fit.
- excitement: Not relevant.
- fear: Not applicable.
- gratitude: Doesn't fit.
- grief: Not relevant.
- joy: Doesn't seem to be the case.
- love: Not applicable.
- nervousness: Doesn't fit.
- optimism: Not relevant.
- pride: Doesn't fit.
- realization: Not applicable.
- relief: Doesn't fit.
- remorse: Not relevant.
- sadness: Doesn't seem to be the case.
- surprise: Not applicable.

After evaluating all options, ""annoyance"" is the emotion that best fits the context of the text.

Answer: annoyance",annoyance,1

Text:
i honestly hope you 99zzyyaa do that
</think>

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text says, ""i honestly hope you 99zzyyaa do that."" The phrase ""hope you do that"" suggests a desire for someone to take a specific action. This indicates a positive wish or longing, which aligns with the emotion of desire. 

Desire is the strong feeling of wanting something to happen or wishing for a particular outcome. In this case, the speaker is expressing a hope that the person ""99zzyyaa"" will do something, which reflects a desire for that action to occur. 

Other emotions like approval or excitement could be considered, but they don't capture the essence of hoping for an action as accurately as desire. Therefore, the emotion expressed is desire.

Answer: desire",desire,0

holy shit chance
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the text ""holy shit chance."" Let's break it down step by step.

First, the phrase ""holy shit"" is an exclamation that often conveys surprise or shock. It can be used in various contexts, but here it seems to be reacting to ""chance."" The word ""chance"" likely refers to an unexpected occurrence or opportunity.

Putting it together, ""holy shit chance"" suggests that the speaker is reacting to an unexpected event. The exclamation indicates a strong emotional response. Considering the list of emotions, surprise is the one that fits best because it's about reacting to something unexpected or startling.

I don't think it's fear because there's no indication of danger. It's not excitement because the reaction seems more about shock than enthusiasm. Surprise seems to capture the essence of reacting to an unexpected situation.

First, ""55m-ghq"" – I'm not sure what that stands for. Maybe it's some kind of code or abbreviation? Then ""weird vm00p way to spell boys"" – okay, so someone is talking about a weird way to spell ""boys."" Maybe they're referring to a typo or some kind of alternative spelling. 

Next, ""klxklxklx"" – that looks like a repeated pattern of letters. Maybe it's some kind of code or a typo. Then ""do not turbo yuiyuiyui grafx"" – ""turbo"" is a word I recognize, and ""yuiyuiyui"" and ""grafx"" might be more abbreviations or typos.

Putting it all together, the text seems to be a jumble of words and letters that don't form a coherent sentence. It's hard to understand the message here. The person might be trying to convey something, but the way they're expressing it is unclear or confusing.

Looking back at the list of emotions, I need to see which one fits. The text doesn't express a strong emotion like anger or joy. Instead, it seems more like the person is confused or trying to make sense of something. The use of random letters and unclear phrasing suggests confusion.

So, I think the emotion expressed here is ""confusion."" The text is a mix of unclear words and abbreviations, making it difficult to understand the intended message. This confusion is likely the emotion being conveyed.

The text expresses a negative sentiment towards the website, mentioning ""cancer"" and ""harassment.""

Text:
well one of them is a dirty kimono wearing weirdo
Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text. Let me start by reading the text again: ""well one of them is a dirty kimono wearing weirdo."" Hmm, the person is calling someone a ""dirty kimono wearing weirdo."" That sounds like they're being critical or negative about that person.

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to see which one fits this context. The person is expressing a negative opinion, so emotions like anger, annoyance, disapproval, or disgust come to mind. The term ""dirty"" and ""weirdo"" are derogatory, which suggests disapproval or disgust.

Disapproval means not approving of someone's actions or characteristics. Disgust is a stronger emotion, often related to finding something unpleasant or offensive. In this case, the person is clearly expressing a negative judgment about the other person's appearance or behavior.

So, between disapproval and disgust, I think disapproval is more appropriate here because the focus is on the judgment rather than a visceral reaction. The person is expressing that they don't approve of the other person's choice of clothing or overall appearance.

Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is disapproval.

Answer: disapproval",disapproval,0

The text expresses a feeling of uncertainty and doubt about the topic of stars.

Text:
they said texas brrtzz44 ! woooooo texas
Alright, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text: ""they said texas brrtzz44 ! woooooo texas"". Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the text, it seems like someone is reacting to something about Texas. The use of ""brrtzz44"" is unclear, but the exclamation marks and the repeated ""wooooooo"" suggest excitement. The word ""texas"" is emphasized, which could indicate pride or joy related to Texas.

Next, considering the list of emotions provided, I need to match the tone of the text. The exclamation marks and the elongated ""wooooooo"" convey a sense of enthusiasm and energy. This points towards positive emotions like joy, excitement, or pride.

Looking at the options, ""excitement"" and ""joy"" are strong candidates. ""Excitement"" often involves a sense of eagerness or thrill, which fits with the enthusiastic tone. ""Joy"" is more about happiness, which also fits but might be a bit more subdued.

Additionally, the mention of Texas could evoke pride, especially if the person is a resident or has a strong connection to the state. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention pride, just excitement.

Putting it all together, the most fitting emotion from the list is ""excitement"" because of the enthusiastic tone and the emphasis on Texas.

The text appears to be a series of random letters and numbers, possibly a typo or a placeholder. Without clear context or meaning, it's challenging to identify the emotion being expressed. However, if we consider the possibility that the text is a request for a rematch or a competitive situation, emotions like ""desire,"" ""excitement,"" or ""nervousness"" could be inferred. Given the lack of clarity, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact emotion.

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I will analyze the content and tone of the message. The text includes words like ""fucking love"" and ""best couple,"" which indicate strong positive feelings. The use of ""fucking"" might suggest intensity, but in this context, it is likely emphasizing the depth of affection rather than expressing anger or frustration. The mention of ""plmxy7q name name"" seems to be a username or handle, and ""do not me"" might be a typo or incomplete thought, but it doesn't change the overall positive sentiment. The repetition of ""name"" could be an attempt to refer to someone specific, reinforcing the idea of admiration or approval. Given these elements, the emotion conveyed is admiration, as the text expresses a high regard and affection for someone or a couple.

The text begins with ""i do not cry either it is weird,"" which suggests a sense of confusion or bewilderment about not crying. The user then writes a series of random letters and numbers, which might indicate a lack of focus or coherence in their thoughts. The phrase ""i think"" appears multiple times, but the sentences are fragmented and unclear. The mention of ""personality mentality"" and ""how your brain is wired"" could imply that the user is trying to understand or explain their own emotional state but is struggling to articulate it clearly. Overall, the text conveys a sense of confusion and bewilderment due to the disjointed thoughts and the attempt to make sense of something unclear.

The text ""rest in peaches j xxlwwkq3 fzznmm22 d plmxy7q or plmxy7q whatever his name was nice meme"" seems to be a mix of casual language and internet slang. The phrase ""rest in peaches"" is a playful variation of ""rest in peace,"" often used humorously or sarcastically. The mention of ""nice meme"" suggests a lighthearted or amused tone. The use of random letters and numbers like ""xxlwwkq3"" and ""fzznmm22"" adds to the casual and possibly humorous nature of the text. Overall, the emotion expressed here is likely amusement.

The text provided appears to be a jumble of letters and numbers, which makes it difficult to interpret the emotional tone. However, if we try to parse the meaningful parts, phrases like ""he is gone"" and ""hope we can get a late mid round pick for him"" suggest a sense of loss or disappointment.

refreshmentos ! what is that ? pplqz1z1 brrtzz44 it is new !
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let me start by reading the text carefully.

The text says: ""refreshmentos ! what is that ? pplqz1z1 brrtzz44 it is new !""

Hmm, the first thing I notice is the use of exclamation marks, which usually indicate strong emotion. The words ""refreshmentos"" and ""pplqz1z1 brrtzz44"" look like they might be typos or perhaps some kind of code or inside joke. The person is asking, ""what is that?"" and then says, ""it is new!"" So, they're reacting to something they've come across, which seems to be new and possibly confusing or intriguing to them.

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to see which one fits best. Let's go through some possibilities:

- **Confusion**: The person is asking ""what is that?"" which suggests they don't understand something. But they also say ""it is new,"" which could indicate curiosity rather than just confusion.
  
- **Curiosity**: The person is reacting to something new, which might spark their interest. The exclamation marks could show excitement or eagerness to learn more.

- **Amusement**: There's no clear indication that the person is laughing or finding something funny.

- **Surprise**: The person might be surprised by the new thing, but the text doesn't explicitly show that.

- **Excitement**: The exclamation marks could indicate excitement, but the main focus seems to be on the newness and possibly confusion.

Between confusion and curiosity, I think curiosity is a better fit because the person is engaging with something new and trying to understand it, even if they're a bit confused. The use of exclamation marks also adds to the sense of eagerness or interest.

So, after considering the context and the emotions listed, I believe the emotion expressed here is curiosity.

Answer: curiosity",curiosity,0

The text describes a pet as ""dumb but wonderful,"" ""silly,"" ""soft,"" and ""adorable."" These words convey a sense of affection and fondness towards the pet.

</think>

The text asks, ""can you kqqz0z0z go see her in person?"" The use of the word ""kqqz0z0z"" seems out of place and possibly a typo or placeholder, which might indicate confusion or uncertainty. The request to ""go see her in person"" could express a desire to meet someone, but the awkward phrasing suggests the speaker might be unsure or confused about how to proceed. Therefore, the emotion expressed here is likely confusion.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. The user provided a text that seems to be a mix of words and random numbers and letters. The task is to identify the emotion from the given list that the text expresses.

First, I'll look at the text: ""let it 338 retetetet go brrtzz44 look pzxq88lm mzznplw4 to rrxq99aa brrtzz44 the wqxpzzl future pllqqq do not zzqqmm22 789 live in the past."" At first glance, it's a bit confusing because of the random strings of letters and numbers. But if I ignore the random parts, the message seems to be advising someone to let go of the past and focus on the future.

The key phrases here are ""let it go,"" ""look to the future,"" and ""do not live in the past."" These phrases suggest a message of moving forward, which is often associated with emotions like relief, optimism, or even joy. However, considering the context, it's more about letting go of something negative, which could be tied to relief or realization.

Looking at the list of emotions, relief is the feeling of reassurance or relaxation after a period of anxiety or distress. Realization is the understanding of something that wasn't clear before. In this case, the text is encouraging letting go of the past, which could imply a sense of relief from past burdens or a realization that focusing on the future is better.

I don't see any signs of anger, sadness, or other negative emotions here. The tone is more about moving forward, which leans towards positive emotions. Among the options, relief seems the most fitting because it's about releasing past stress or worries.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is relief.

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I will analyze the content and tone of the message. The text mentions ""bad news"" and addresses someone as ""champ,"" which suggests a supportive or empathetic tone. The use of ""champ"" indicates an attempt to comfort or uplift the recipient despite delivering unfavorable information. This combination of delivering difficult news while showing concern aligns with the emotion of **remorse**, as it reflects a sense of regret or apology for the situation.

Step-by-step explanation:

The text describes a situation where two testers are upset about a specific change (rolling their klxklxklx into 0.5). The speaker is unsure if the testers' reaction is justified and feels bad about it, considering apologizing. This indicates a sense of regret or guilt for causing the testers' upset, which aligns with the emotion of remorse.

honestly i agree we should xplmrr00 jhqwxp77 shun 99zzyyaa vegetarians regardless of the gorggorggorg name thing
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the emotion expressed in the text. Let me start by reading the text carefully. The text says: ""honestly i agree we should xplmrr00 jhqwxp77 shun 99zzyyaa vegetarians regardless of the gorggorggorg name thing."" 

Hmm, the first thing I notice is that there are some random strings of letters and numbers, like ""xplmrr00"" and ""jhxwqp77."" Those don't seem to make sense in English, so maybe they're typos or some kind of coded message. But the main part that stands out is ""shun 99zzyyaa vegetarians."" 

""Shun"" means to avoid or exclude someone, so it seems like the person is agreeing with the idea of excluding vegetarians. The phrase ""regardless of the gorggorggorg name thing"" is a bit confusing. Maybe ""gorggorggorg"" is a typo or a name that's supposed to be something else, like ""George"" or another name. 

Putting it all together, the person is agreeing to exclude vegetarians, which could indicate a negative emotion towards them. The use of ""shun"" suggests a strong dislike or disapproval. So, the emotion here is likely ""disapproval"" because the person is expressing a negative judgment towards vegetarians. 

I don't think it's ""anger"" because there's no indication of intense frustration. ""Disgust"" might be possible, but it's more about a strong aversion, which ""disapproval"" also covers. ""Disappointment"" doesn't fit because there's no sense of unmet expectations. So, ""disapproval"" seems to be the best fit here.",MISSING,0

no it is definitely pplqz1z1 mmzqrr8 you time pzxq88lm pzxq88lm for vxvxvz22 you to grow up
Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion expressed in the text. The text is a bit confusing with all the random letters and numbers, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll read the text carefully: ""no it is definitely pplqz1z1 mmzqrr8 you time pzxq88lm pzxq88lm for vxvxvz22 you to grow up."" Hmm, it's hard to make sense of it because of all the jumbled letters and numbers. Maybe the person is trying to convey something but made a mistake in typing or is using some kind of code.

Looking at the structure, the sentence starts with ""no it is definitely..."" which suggests a strong disagreement or correction. The repeated phrases like ""pplqz1z1 mmzqrr8"" and ""pzxq88lm"" could be typos or perhaps intentional, but without context, it's unclear. The ending ""for vxvxvz22 you to grow up"" seems to be advising someone to mature or grow up, which might indicate frustration or impatience.

Considering the emotions listed, the text doesn't show obvious signs of admiration, amusement, or love. It's more likely to be a negative emotion. The use of ""no"" and the repeated phrases could indicate confusion or maybe even anger if the person is frustrated with the situation.

Another angle is that the person might be trying to express something but is struggling, which could lead to feelings of confusion or frustration. However, without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact emotion.

Given the options, I think the emotion is probably ""confusion"" because the text is hard to decipher, and the structure is unclear. Alternatively, it could be ""annoyance"" if the person is frustrated with the situation they're describing.

Wait, the repeated phrases might be a typo, which could indicate that the person is in a hurry or upset, leading to more frustration. So maybe ""annoyance"" is a better fit.

But I'm still leaning towards ""confusion"" because the message is not clear, and it's hard to understand what the person is trying to say.

After considering all possibilities, I think the emotion is ""confusion.""

Answer: confusion",confusion,0

The text appears to be a jumble of numbers and letters, making it difficult to discern any clear emotion. However, based on the context, the speaker seems uncertain or confused about their role as an instructional coach versus a teacher. This could indicate a sense of confusion or uncertainty.

To determine the emotion expressed in the text, I'll analyze the content and context. The text mentions ""exciting game,"" which directly indicates a positive and thrilling feeling.

The text appears to be a mix of coherent words and random strings of letters, making it difficult to parse the intended meaning. The phrase ""intelligence is to know the difference between mb and mbps"" suggests a focus on understanding technical distinctions, while the latter part, ""wisdom is to not be a cunt about it,"" introduces a vulgar expression that conveys frustration or irritation. The random strings of letters may be an attempt to obscure or add confusion to the message. Overall, the text seems to express a mix of frustration and confusion, with the vulgar language indicating annoyance or anger. However, the primary emotion conveyed is likely **anger** due to the explicit use of offensive language.

no thanks he is already pplqz1z1 38u7zz been flushed
</think>

The text provided is: ""no thanks he is already pplqz1z1 38u7zz been flushed."" 

First, I need to understand the context and sentiment of this text. The phrase ""no thanks"" is often used to decline an offer or show disinterest, which can indicate a negative emotion. The mention of ""he is already"" suggests that the person being referred to is in a certain state or situation. The strings ""pplqz1z1"" and ""38u7zz"" appear to be random characters, possibly typos or placeholders, which might indicate confusion or frustration in the message. The word ""flushed"" could imply that something has been cleared or eliminated, which might relate to relief or disappointment depending on the context.

Considering the list of emotions, ""disappointment"" seems to fit because the speaker is declining something and possibly expressing dissatisfaction with the situation. The use of ""no thanks"" and the mention of the person being ""already"" in a certain state could imply that the speaker feels let down or unhappy about the circumstances.

Answer: disappointment",disappointment,0

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text mentions ""the miracle was just that"" and refers to the Vikings failing the next game. The use of ""miracle"" suggests a surprising or unexpected event, which aligns with the emotion of surprise. The mention of failure in the next game adds a layer of disbelief, reinforcing the idea that the speaker is surprised by the outcome. Therefore, the emotion expressed is surprise.

The text seems to express a mix of emotions, but the dominant emotion appears to be **disappointment**. The speaker is critical of the person's face but acknowledges her positive traits like her ""giving personality."" This contrast suggests a sense of letdown or dissatisfaction with her appearance despite her good qualities.

it zzoomm11 is the jhqwxp77 nno0ppll universe trying to klxklxklx yzyzyzyz kill us with radiation d
Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. The text is a bit confusing with all the random letters and numbers, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the text says, ""it zzoomm11 is the jhqwxp77 nno0ppll universe trying to klxklxklx yzyzyzyz kill us with radiation d"". The main words I can make out are ""zoom"", ""universe"", ""trying"", ""kill"", and ""radiation"". So, it seems like the person is talking about the universe or something in it trying to kill us with radiation.

Now, considering the emotion list: admiration, amusement, anger, annoyance, approval, caring, confusion, curiosity, desire, disappointment, disapproval, disgust, embarrassment, excitement, fear, gratitude, grief, joy, love, nervousness, optimism, pride, realization, relief, remorse, sadness, surprise.

The text mentions being killed by radiation, which is a serious and scary situation. So, the emotion here is likely fear. The person is expressing concern or worry about something dangerous happening.

I don't see any signs of happiness or positive emotions here. It's more about a threatening situation, so fear makes the most sense.

Answer: fear",fear,0

2. The use of slang and informal language suggests a casual and enthusiastic tone.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a text and a list of emotions, and they want me to identify which emotion is expressed in the text. They also want me to start my response with ""Provide detailed step-by-step reasoning here"" and end with ""Answer: [emotion]"".

Looking at the text, it's a bit confusing. It has a mix of words and random strings of letters and numbers. The user wrote, ""oh my name i lzzppq14 wqxpzzl just noticed this too ! i just rewatched it recently and noticed him just fzznmm22 pllqqq drinking some tea xxlwwkq3 next to gxpqrrn name vxvxvz22 and name"". 

At first glance, the text seems to be about someone noticing something while rewatching something, maybe a show or a movie. They mention drinking tea and being next to someone named ""gxpqrrn"". The random strings of letters and numbers could be typos or placeholders, making it harder to understand the context.

Given the list of emotions, I need to figure out which one fits. The text doesn't clearly express a strong emotion like anger or joy. It's more about noticing something, which could relate to curiosity or realization. The user mentions rewatching and noticing details, which suggests they're paying attention and perhaps discovering something new.

So, considering the context, the emotion is likely ""realization"" because the user is noticing something they hadn't before while rewatching. They're processing new information, which aligns with the emotion of realization.

To sum it up, the text expresses the emotion of realizing something new upon rewatching, which fits the ""realization"" category from the list.

Answer: realization",realization,0

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content. The text mentions wanting someone to ""march to new england and then get spanked,"" which suggests a desire for a specific action to occur. The use of words like ""spanked"" and the repeated phrases ""yuiyuiyui"" and ""retetetet"" add intensity but do not clearly indicate a negative or positive emotion. The overall tone seems to express a strong wish or longing for something to happen, which aligns with the emotion of ""desire.""

i rnggll22 know 123 38u7zz a elt qvnnxa couple of people who are it is qvnnxa amazing rrxq99aa to watch
Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. Let me read it again: ""i rnggll22 know 123 38u7zz a elt qvnnxa couple of people who are it is qvnnxa amazing rrxq99aa to watch"". Hmm, there are a lot of random characters and numbers here. Maybe it's a typo or some kind of cipher? 

Wait, perhaps the user meant to type something else but made a lot of mistakes. Let me try to make sense of it. The sentence seems to be about knowing a couple of people who are ""amazing"" to watch. The word ""amazing"" stands out, so maybe the emotion is related to admiration or approval. 

Looking at the list of emotions, admiration and approval are both possibilities. Admiration is when you respect someone for their qualities, while approval is more about agreeing with something. Since the text mentions that it's ""amazing to watch,"" it sounds more like admiration because it's about appreciating someone's actions or qualities. 

I don't see any negative words here, so emotions like anger or disgust are unlikely. The focus is on something positive, so it's probably a positive emotion. Admiration fits well because it's about valuing someone's skills or talents. 

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed is admiration. The user is expressing admiration for the couple of people they know who are amazing to watch. 

Answer: admiration",admiration,0

</think>

The text expresses a strong dislike or aversion towards a specific situation where someone gets hurt again because they were not fully recovered. The use of words like ""hate"" and the emphasis on not wanting to see another instance of this situation indicate a feeling of disgust. Disgust is the emotion that captures this aversion and strong dislike.

haha jhqwxp77 38u7zz !! the seedy underbelly of xplmrr00 the competitve choir world exposed !!
Okay, let's try to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. The text is: ""haha jhqwxp77 38u7zz !! the seedy underbelly of xplmrr00 the competitve choir world exposed !!""

First, I notice that the text starts with ""haha,"" which is an expression of laughter. That suggests the emotion might be amusement or something similar. 

Next, there are some random strings of letters and numbers: ""jhqwxp77 38u7zz"". These don't seem to form any coherent words, so they might be irrelevant or just added for effect. 

Then, the text mentions ""the seedy underbelly of xplmrr00 the competitve choir world exposed"". The phrase ""seedy underbelly"" usually refers to something shady or not so nice, and ""exposed"" implies that something hidden has been revealed. The use of ""haha"" before this suggests that the person is finding this situation funny or entertaining.

Putting it all together, the emotion seems to be amusement because the person is laughing at the revelation of the not-so-nice side of the choir world. The random strings don't contribute much to the emotion, so they can be ignored.

Answer: amusement",amusement,1

Alright, let's break this down step by step. The text provided is: ""thank dqzmmf91 znqx88aa you next"". 

First, I notice that the message starts with ""thank"", which is a clear expression of gratitude.

i 55m-ghq have still not yuiyuiyui arx9z9z9 noticed 99zzyyaa the kid
Alright, I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the text. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the text is: ""i 55m-ghq have still not yuiyuiyui arx9z9z9 noticed 99zzyyaa the kid."" It looks like there are a lot of random characters and numbers mixed in with the words, which might be distracting or confusing. The main words are ""have still not noticed the kid.""

So, the person is saying that they haven't noticed the kid yet. This could imply that they were waiting or hoping to notice the kid but haven't had the chance or opportunity to do so. The emotion here seems to be one of disappointment because the person expected or wanted to notice the kid but hasn't been able to.

Looking at the list of emotions, disappointment fits well because it's about not meeting an expectation or hope. The other emotions like confusion or surprise might be considered, but disappointment feels more accurate given the context of not noticing something they were likely hoping to see.

Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is disappointment.",MISSING,0

who rqm99zzy cares mzznplw4 xplmrr00 ? season has zmgxpl01 not even started
Alright, I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the text: ""who rqm99zzy cares mzznplw4 xplmrr00 ? season has zmgxpl01 not even started"". It seems like there are some random strings of letters and numbers, which might be typos or some kind of code. The main part that stands out is ""season has not even started"".

Now, focusing on the message: the person is saying that the season hasn't started yet. Depending on the context, this could express different emotions. If the person was looking forward to the season, not having it start yet might lead to disappointment. Alternatively, if they were dreading the season, they might feel relief. But given the phrasing, it seems more like they're expressing that something hasn't happened yet, which could indicate impatience or frustration.

Looking at the list of emotions, ""disappointment"" seems like a strong candidate because the person might be feeling let down that the season hasn't begun. Alternatively, ""annoyance"" could be possible if they're frustrated by the delay. However, ""disappointment"" feels more fitting because it's about unmet expectations.

So, after considering the context and the possible emotions, I think the emotion expressed here is disappointment.
Answer: disappointment",disappointment,0

thank you i arx9z9z9 prax_7 tried
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the emotion expressed in the text ""thank you i arx9z9z9 prax_7 tried"". First, I notice that the text starts with ""thank you"", which is a common expression of gratitude. That makes me think the emotion might be gratitude or maybe appreciation.

But then I see some random characters: ""arx9z9z9 prax_7 tried"". These don't make much sense in English, so I'm guessing it's either a typo or some kind of code or maybe even a joke. It could be that the person is trying to express something else, but the main part is the ""thank you"".

Since ""thank you"" is such a strong indicator of gratitude, I'm leaning towards that emotion. The rest of the text doesn't seem to add much in terms of emotional context. It might just be some random strings of letters and numbers, so I don't think they affect the emotion.

Looking at the list of emotions, gratitude is definitely one of them. So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed here is gratitude.

Step-by-step explanation:
The text expresses a series of questions about someone else revealing personal and negative aspects of the speaker's life. The repeated use of ""he's the one who told you about"" highlights a sense of vulnerability and self-consciousness. The focus on past mistakes, failures, weaknesses, fears, doubts, and insecurities suggests that the speaker feels exposed or ashamed. This aligns with the emotion of embarrassment, as the speaker is likely feeling humiliated or mortified that such personal information has been shared.

come on really i rlrllrllr am bbbbb for gay rights
Okay, so I need to figure out what emotion is expressed in the text provided. The text is: ""come on really i rlrllrllr am bbbbb for gay rights."" 

First, I'll try to parse the text. It looks like there are some random letters and repeated letters, which might indicate frustration or anger. The phrase ""come on really"" suggests exasperation or disbelief. The part ""am bbbbb for gay rights"" seems like the person is emphasizing their support for gay rights, but the ""bbbbbb"" could be a way of showing emphasis or perhaps a typo.

Considering the list of emotions, I need to match the sentiment of the text. The user is expressing support for gay rights, which could indicate approval or love. However, the exasperated tone from ""come on really"" might suggest annoyance or anger. 

But wait, the user is supporting a cause, which is more positive. So maybe it's approval or admiration. However, the exasperation might lean more towards annoyance or anger. 

I think the primary emotion here is frustration or exasperation, which could be categorized under anger or annoyance. But since the user is supporting a cause, perhaps the emotion is more about approval or admiration. 

Looking back, the text is a bit unclear because of the random letters, but the main sentiment seems to be one of support and possibly exasperation at the situation. So maybe the emotion is a mix of approval and anger. 

Given the options, I think the emotion is either approval or anger. Since the user is expressing support, approval seems more likely, but the exasperation might push it towards anger. 

I'm a bit torn, but I'll go with approval because the main action is supporting gay rights.",MISSING,0

First, I'll analyze the content. The phrase ""name was actually wrong"" suggests that there was a mistake regarding someone's name. The repetition of ""qqqqpplm"" and the addition of ""all along jah jokic"" seem to be emphasizing frustration or irritation. 

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to find the one that best fits the sentiment expressed here. The repetition and the additional words like ""all along"" and ""jah jokic"" indicate that the speaker is annoyed or frustrated about the mistake.

thank arx9z9z9 qzzoxxk you 55m-ghq next 456 !
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion is expressed in the given text. The text is: ""thank arx9z9z9 qzzoxxk you 55m-ghq next 456 !""

First, I'll break down the text. It starts with ""thank,"" which is a word of gratitude. Then there are some random strings of letters and numbers: ""arx9z9z9 qzzoxxk you 55m-ghq next 456."" These don't seem to form coherent words or phrases, so they might just be random or perhaps some kind of code or placeholder.

The key word here is ""thank,"" which clearly conveys gratitude. The rest of the text doesn't add much to the emotional context because it's mostly jumbled. There's no indication of any negative emotions like anger, sadness, or fear. Instead, the presence of ""thank"" suggests a positive emotion.

Looking at the list of emotions provided, the most fitting one here is ""gratitude."" The other emotions like joy, love, or approval could be possibilities, but ""gratitude"" is the most direct and appropriate choice given the word ""thank.""

So, after analyzing the text, the emotion expressed is gratitude.
Answer: gratitude",gratitude,1

you mprqzz09 w gorggorggorg 55m-ghq fdddfs said you zlkqp55 pllqqq are funny you are shilly
Okay, so I need to figure out which emotion from the list is expressed in the given text. Let me start by reading the text carefully. The text is: ""you mprqzz09 w gorggorggorg 55m-ghq fdddfs said you zlkqp55 pllqqq are funny you are shilly."" Hmm, that looks like a mix of random letters and words. Maybe it's some kind of code or a typo?

Wait, perhaps it's not random. Let me try to parse it. The first part is ""you mprqzz09 w gorggorggorg 55m-ghq fdddfs."" That seems like a string of characters without much meaning. Then it says ""said you zlkqp55 pllqqq are funny you are shilly."" Okay, so someone is saying that another person is funny, but ends with ""you are shilly."" Shilly doesn't make sense; maybe it's a typo for ""silly""?

If that's the case, the message is saying that someone is funny but also silly. So the emotion here could be amusement because the person is finding something funny. Alternatively, if ""silly"" is meant to be derogatory, maybe it's a mix of amusement and something else. But looking at the list of emotions, amusement is a likely candidate.

Wait, but the text is a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the possibility of a different emotion. If the person is being called silly, maybe it's a bit of embarrassment or something else. But the main part is that they are called funny, which is positive. So amusement seems more fitting.

Let me cross-check with the list. Amusement is definitely on the list. So I think the emotion expressed here is amusement.",MISSING,0

omg yes brrtzz44 rlrllrllr !
Alright, let's break this down step by step to figure out the emotion expressed in the text.

First, I'll look at the text provided: ""omg yes brrtzz44 rlrllrllr !"". The user has used several elements here that might indicate an emotion.

1. **""omg""**: This is an acronym for ""Oh My God,"" which is often used to express surprise, excitement, or shock. It's a common expression of strong emotion.

2. **""yes""**: This is a straightforward affirmative response, indicating agreement or enthusiasm.

3. **""brrtzz44""**: This seems like a random string of letters and numbers. It could be a username, a code, or just something the user found amusing or interesting. Without more context, it's hard to say, but it might be used to express amusement or curiosity.

4. **""rlrllrllr""**: This looks like a pattern of letters, possibly a sequence or something repeated. It could be a way to express excitement or nervousness, as people sometimes use repetitive patterns when they're feeling a strong emotion.

5. **""!""**: The exclamation mark at the end adds emphasis, indicating strong emotion.

Putting it all together, the text starts with a strong expression (""omg""), followed by agreement (""yes""), then some random strings, and ends with an exclamation mark. The combination of ""omg,"" ""yes,"" and the exclamation mark suggests a positive and strong emotion. The random strings might be adding to the excitement or surprise.

Considering the list of emotions, ""excitement"" seems to fit best here. The user is expressing a strong positive reaction, which aligns with excitement. Other emotions like ""amusement"" or ""surprise"" could also be considered, but the overall tone leans more towards excitement.

The text discusses the possibility that constant complaining about ""dmc"" was one of several factors that could have led to someone drifting apart from others.

yes that is exactly xplmrr00 zzzzjqpa what qmplxz happened
Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand the text provided. The text is: ""yes that is exactly xplmrr00 zzzzjqpa what qmplxz happened."" At first glance, this seems a bit confusing because of the random strings of letters and numbers. It doesn't form a coherent sentence, which makes it hard to grasp the intended meaning.

Now, looking at the context, the user is asking to identify an emotion from a given list based on this text. The list includes emotions like admiration, amusement, anger, and so on. My task is to figure out which emotion is being expressed here.

Given that the text is unclear and contains nonsensical strings, it might indicate confusion on the part of the speaker. They're trying to convey something but aren't making much sense, which could suggest they're confused or unsure about what happened. Alternatively, the randomness could be interpreted as frustration or anger, but without more context, it's challenging to be certain.

Considering the list of emotions, confusion seems like the most fitting choice because the text itself is confusing and doesn't convey a clear message. The speaker might be expressing uncertainty or bewilderment about the situation they're describing.

So, after analyzing the text and the possible emotions, I conclude that the emotion expressed is confusion.

look yuiyuiyui on the bright side i do not know what your bright 338 side is but just plmxy7q look at zlrp33 rrxq99aa it
Alright, let's try to figure out the emotion expressed in this text. The text is a bit confusing with all the random letters and numbers, but I'll do my best.

First, I'll read the text again to get a better sense of it: ""look yuiyuiyui on the bright side i do not know what your bright 338 side is but just plmxy7q look at zlrp33 rrxq99aa it."" Okay, so there's a lot of jumbled letters and numbers here. The first part says ""look yuiyuiyui on the bright side,"" which seems like someone is trying to be positive or encouraging. The phrase ""bright side"" is a common expression meaning to focus on the positive aspects of a situation.

However, the rest of the text is filled with random characters, which makes it hard to understand the intended message. The person might be trying to convey something positive but is struggling to express it clearly, possibly due to frustration or confusion. The use of random letters and numbers could indicate that the person is feeling overwhelmed or is perhaps being sarcastic.

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to find the one that best fits this scenario. The person is trying to be positive but is hindered by confusion or frustration. The emotions that come to mind are confusion, frustration, or maybe even amusement if the jumbled text is meant to be funny. But since the main message seems to be about focusing on the bright side despite confusion, I think the primary emotion here is confusion.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is confusion because the message is unclear and jumbled, making it difficult to understand the intended positivity.",MISSING,0

The text appears to be a mix of casual conversation and possibly some coded or placeholder language (""vm00p,"" ""zlrp33,"" ""qxjx92a__pllqqq,"" etc.), which makes it a bit unclear in terms of emotional expression. However, the phrase ""that is what I would hope for"" suggests a sense of optimism or hope. The use of ""hope"" indicates a positive outlook or desire for a particular outcome. 

Considering the list of emotions, ""optimism"" seems to be the most fitting choice, as it reflects a hopeful and positive attitude towards a situation.

i retetetet 99zzyyaa just rxxjpl nno0ppll unassigned and yzyzyzyz pplqz1z1 left
Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the given text. The text is: ""i retetetet 99zzyyaa just rxxjpl nno0ppll unassigned and yzyzyzyz pplqz1z1 left."" 

First, I'll try to understand what's going on here. The text seems to be a mix of random letters and numbers, which might indicate some kind of frustration or confusion. Maybe the person is trying to type something but is making a lot of mistakes or is in a hurry. 

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to match the feeling conveyed by this text. The text doesn't express a clear emotion like joy or sadness, but the random typing could suggest confusion or frustration. However, frustration isn't directly listed, so I have to pick the closest one. 

Confusion is definitely a possibility because the text is hard to read and understand. The person might be feeling confused about what they're trying to convey. Alternatively, it could be a sign of nervousness if they're anxious and making typing errors. 

But considering the context, confusion seems more likely because the message is unclear and filled with random characters. The person might be confused about how to express themselves or what they're trying to say. 

So, after analyzing, I think the emotion expressed here is confusion.",MISSING,0

you are right it is relatable hope everything ok 338 fzznmm22 for pllqqq plmxy7q you
Alright, let's break this down. The user provided a text and wants to identify the emotion from a given list. The text is: ""you are right it is relatable hope everything ok 338 fzznmm22 for pllqqq plmxy7q you."" 

First, I notice that the text starts with agreement (""you are right"") and mentions that something is relatable. This suggests a positive or understanding tone. The phrase ""hope everything ok"" adds a layer of concern or well-wishing, which leans towards positive emotions like gratitude or relief.

Looking at the list of emotions, ""gratitude"" stands out because the speaker is acknowledging someone else's point and expressing hope for their well-being. ""Relief"" could also be considered, but the text doesn't explicitly mention overcoming a difficulty, which is often associated with relief.

The rest of the text includes random numbers and letters, which might be placeholders or irrelevant to the emotional context. Therefore, focusing on the meaningful parts, the emotion expressed is likely gratitude.

Answer: gratitude",gratitude,0

well vxvxvz22 arx9z9z9 i am trying to improve man
Okay, let's see. The text is ""well vxvxvz22 arx9z9z9 i am trying to improve man"". Hmm, first, I notice that there are some random strings of letters and numbers at the beginning. That might be a typo or some kind of placeholder. The main part is ""i am trying to improve man"". 

So, the person is talking about trying to improve. That could indicate a few emotions. Maybe they're feeling determined or ambitious. But looking at the list of emotions, I don't see ""determination"" or ""ambition"". The closest might be ""optimism"" or ""pride"". 

Wait, ""trying to improve"" could show a positive outlook, so ""optimism"" seems possible. Alternatively, if they're reflecting on past actions, maybe ""remorse"" or ""realization"". But the text doesn't mention anything about past mistakes. 

Another angle: the random strings might be a distraction, but the core message is about improvement. So, it's more about looking forward, which aligns with ""optimism"". 

I think the emotion here is ""optimism"" because the person is focused on getting better, which is a positive and hopeful sentiment.

To determine the emotion expressed in the text, I will analyze the content and tone of the message. The text says: ""trailer pplqz1z1 fabulous !!! vvrraaxx i miss it."" 

First, I notice the use of exclamation marks, which often indicate strong emotions. The word ""fabulous"" suggests a positive sentiment, and ""i miss it"" conveys a longing or nostalgia. Combining these elements, the emotion appears to be one of nostalgia or longing. However, looking at the list of emotions provided, ""sadness"" is the closest match, as missing something can evoke feelings of sadness or melancholy.

and why would i do bbbbb qxjx92a__pllqqq that ? zzoomm11 edit thanks for setting up 55m-ghq that walder frey line mzznplw4 qvnnxa for retetetet me
Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the text provided. Let me start by reading the text carefully.

The text is: ""and why would i do bbbbb qxjx92a__pllqqq that ? zzoomm11 edit thanks for setting up 55m-ghq that walder frey line mzznplw4 qvnnxa for retetetet me""

Hmm, at first glance, it looks a bit messy with random letters and numbers interspersed. It seems like the person is expressing some frustration or confusion. The use of repetitive letters like ""bbbbb"" and ""zzoomm11"" might indicate that the person is agitated or annoyed. Also, the phrase ""why would i do that"" suggests some level of confusion or frustration.

Looking at the list of emotions, confusion seems to fit here because the person is questioning their own actions and the text is unclear. There's also a bit of frustration, but since the main issue is the confusion about why they did something, confusion is the primary emotion.

Wait, but the text also includes some thanks: ""thanks for setting up."" That part is positive, but the overall tone seems more negative. The thanks might be genuine, but the confusion and frustration are more prominent.

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed is likely confusion because the person is questioning their actions and the text is filled with random characters, indicating uncertainty or bewilderment.

The text ""this zzzzjqpa gorggorggorg is amazing wtf"" contains an exclamation of ""amazing"" and ""wtf,"" which suggests a strong positive reaction. The word ""amazing"" indicates admiration, while ""wtf"" (an informal expression of surprise or astonishment) aligns with the emotion of surprise. However, since the primary sentiment expressed is admiration due to the use of ""amazing,"" the emotion is admiration.

oh no kqqz0z0z i agree lzzppq14 that its edited but i think she has other things going on too bdd mqx9nnq zlkqp55 at least
Okay, so I need to figure out the emotion expressed in the given text. Let's start by reading the text carefully.

The text is: ""oh no kqqz0z0z i agree lzzppq14 that its edited but i think she has other things going on too bdd mqx9nnq zlkqp55 at least""

First, I notice that there are a lot of random letters and numbers mixed in with the words. This makes the text a bit confusing and hard to understand. The user is trying to express something, but the presence of these random strings might indicate that they're either using some form of coded language or perhaps they're frustrated and just typing randomly.

Looking at the actual words: ""oh no"" usually indicates worry or concern. The user agrees with someone named lzzppq14 that something is edited. Then they mention that ""she has other things going on too,"" which might suggest that the user is trying to understand or consider another perspective. The words ""at least"" at the end could imply relief or acceptance.

Putting this together, the user seems to be expressing a mix of concern and maybe relief. However, the random strings of letters and numbers make the overall message unclear, which could indicate confusion on the part of the user. They might be trying to convey something but are having trouble doing so, leading to confusion.

Looking at the list of emotions, confusion seems to fit here because the text is hard to parse, and the user might be struggling to express their thoughts clearly. The mixture of coherent words and random characters adds to the confusion.

So, the emotion expressed in the text is confusion.",MISSING,0

The text provided is ""it is nseg qmplxz going 101112 to plmxy7q get awfully xxyyzz8899 qxjx92a__pllqqq dark and cold at night."" Upon analyzing the text, it seems to describe a situation that is dark and cold at night. The words ""dark"" and ""cold"" evoke a sense of gloom or sadness. There is no indication of other emotions like anger, fear, or excitement. Therefore, the emotion expressed in the text is sadness.

</think>

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the content and tone. The text discusses someone's feelings about not being tall enough to ride roller coasters at Disneyland. The mention of ""feelings"" and the context of being unable to enjoy an activity due to height suggests a sense of unmet expectations or longing. This aligns with the emotion of ""disappointment,"" as the individual is likely upset about not being able to experience something they care about.

</think>

The text appears to be a jumble of random characters and words, making it difficult to discern any clear emotion. However, if we attempt to extract meaning from the text, the phrase ""my mom"" and ""handsomest nfl coach"" might suggest admiration or approval. The rest of the text does not provide enough context to confidently identify an emotion. Given the limited information, the most plausible emotion from the list is admiration.

The text expresses strong disapproval and disgust towards the idea of targeting asylum seekers. The use of harsh language and the repetition of ""retetetet"" emphasize the speaker's outrage and moral condemnation of the action. The word ""appalling"" further highlights the intense negative emotion. 

Answer: disgust",disgust,0

Hmm, the text seems a bit jumbled with random letters and words. The use of ""hurr durr"" is a bit informal and might indicate some frustration or sarcasm. The phrase ""needs to worry"" suggests that the speaker is annoyed or frustrated with others for worrying about their problems. 

Looking at the list of emotions, I need to match this sentiment. The speaker seems to be expressing irritation or frustration, which could align with ""annoyance."" Alternatively, it might be ""anger,"" but the tone doesn't seem as intense as anger. It's more about being annoyed by others' concerns. 

So, putting it all together, the emotion expressed in the text is likely ""annoyance.""",MISSING,0

</think>

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I first analyze the language used. The text contains a lot of repetitive and nonsensical words, along with profanity such as ""fucking."" This suggests frustration or irritation. The structure of the sentences is disjointed, which could indicate confusion or a lack of coherent thought. Additionally, the use of exclamation marks might amplify the emotional intensity. Considering the list of emotions, ""confusion"" seems to fit because the text lacks clear meaning and is filled with random words. ""Frustration"" could also be a possibility due to the use of profanity, but since the text is more about disjointedness than anger, ""confusion"" is the better choice.

To identify the emotion expressed in the text, I will analyze the content and tone of the message. The text mentions ""the longest week"" and describes something as ""pretty good"" and ""romantic comedy."" The use of positive adjectives like ""good"" and the reference to a romantic comedy genre suggest a sense of enjoyment or happiness. Additionally, the mention of looking forward to something (""still available"") indicates anticipation, which is closely related to excitement. 

Considering the list of emotions, ""excitement"" best captures the positive and anticipatory tone of the text.

The repetition of ""retetetet"" could be an expression of irritation or exasperation. The phrase ""ebg sad"" seems to be a typo or shorthand, but ""sad"" clearly conveys sadness. However, the overall tone of the text leans more towards frustration or annoyance due to the use of ""loser"" and the repetitive, possibly exasperated ""retetetet."" Therefore, the emotion expressed is likely **annoyance**.
